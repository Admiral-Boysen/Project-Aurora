 totalist_subtype_desc:0 "This new ideology created by Mosley, envision a new doctrine based on state controlled economics, the total involvement of the state in internal affairs and the importance of the state in preserving Socialism. This hard left and authoritarian doctrine advocates a massive centralisation of power instead of the more democratic support to the trade unions endorsed by Syndicalism. Another central tenant of Totalism is the focus on military power and the desire to spread the ideology with force if need be."
 syndicalist_subtype_desc:0 "Syndicalism is the leading revolutionary ideology and is based on federations of collectivized trade unions. It is a form of economic corporatism that advocates interest aggregation of multiple non-competitive categorized units to negotiate and manage an economy. It holds, on an ethical basis, that all participants in an organized trade internally share equal ownership of its production. Industry in a syndicalist system is run through co-operative confederations and mutual aid."
 radical_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "Radical Socialism is a toned down version of orthodox syndicalism, with more democratic structures and safeguards in place. For example among the trade unions there are more frequent and contested elections, with members regularly challenging incumbents, and resultant turnover in officers and representative, with open and free debate and discussion of issues and candidates. Moreover open publications are encouraged, with newspapers and pamphlets publishing all members' views, including those critical of officials, representatives, or union policy."
