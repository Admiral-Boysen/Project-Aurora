  amcivwar.83.t:0 "Anarchists Cause Trouble"
  amcivwar.83.d:0 "A small group of anarchists that have always been on the fringe of the CSA have begun to make trouble. They are complaining that the CSA's policies are detrimental to the anarchist movement and are demanding reforms. They are threatening the stability of the CSA's war effort."

  amcivwar.84.d:0 "The capture of Atlanta by enemy forces have forced Long and his men to look to Reed and the CSA for help. Reed and the CSA were not in very good shape either as they were losing the war as well and Long seriously considered making a deal with the devil."
  amcivwar.84.a:0 "We have no choice."
  amcivwar.84.b:0 "No deals with Reed."
  amcivwar.85.t:0 "Deal With the Devil"
  amcivwar.85.d:0 "With the defeat of the AUS imminent, Long had sent an envoy to Reed's camp to discuss the possibilities of an alliance. Trusting Long would be foolish but as Reed's position was not as strong as it could be and an alliance would help the war effort."
  amcivwar.85.a:0 "No deals with Long"
  amcivwar.85.b:0 "An alliance. For now."
  amcivwar.86.t:0 "Deal With the Devil signed"

  amcivwar.88.t:0 "Dixie Metal"
  amcivwar.88.d:0 "The war was hard on the American Union State as it had less resources than the other powers. The people of the AUS rallied and began handing in pots and pans to be melted to support the war effort. This increased the metal supply in the American Union State."

  amcivwar.91.t:0 "Coloured Units"
  amcivwar.91.d:0 "The racial tensions of the south did not mean that some African-Americans didn't decide to fight for the American Union State. They were initially turned away from recruiting stations but soon more were demanding the right to serve. The American Union forces could use the extra manpower but there was a fear that this could lead to racial tensions."
  amcivwar.91.a:0 "They can fight like anyone else."
  amcivwar.91.b:0 "This is not the time for this."
