### Event text ###
  ustates.1.t:0 "A Day In September"
  ustates.1.d:0 "The social and political consensus in American society has broken down, and the current Presidential Election Campaign is like nothing we have ever seen.  The America First-Union party is organising right-wing militias in the South and Mid-West and Communists control the streets of Chicago and Detroit.  Senior military commanders believe that it may be necessary to cancel the election and suspend the Constitution if we are to avoid complete social breakdown."
  ustates.1.a:0 "The elections must go ahead"
  ustates.1.b:0 "Invite the military to step in to save the country"
  ustates.2.t:0 "Emergency Security Act"
  ustates.2.d:0 "MacArthur's first act was to reestablish order on the streets of America. He proposed the Emergency Security Act which would give MacArthur the power to arrest and detain suspected members of un-American organizations. This was a thin cover for MacArthurs anti-socialist agenda and with the support of the America First it was more than likely going to be enacted."
  ustates.2.a:0 "Pass the act"
  ustates.2.b:0 "This is still a democracy" 
  ustates.3.t:0 "The Fourth of July"
  ustates.3.d:0 "Independence Day, also known as the Fourth of July, celebrations took place today all across the country.

  ustates.3.a:0 "We shall celebrate the democratic ideals!" 
  ustates.4.t:0 "The Indian Citizenship Act of 1936"
  ustates.4.d:0 "In order to try to gain more sympathy from the North and the West, it has been proposed by the Senate and the House that a Indian Citizenship Act be passed, granting all indigenous peoples of the United States elevation from second-class citizens to first."
  ustates.4.a:0 "Pass the Act, hopefully this will gain us some sympathy"
  ustates.4.b:0 "Veto the Bill" 
  ustates.5.t:0 "The Battle of the Overpass"
  ustates.5.d:0 "In Detroit, Michigan, Automotive Capital of the World, leaders of the United Auto Workers Walter Reuther and Richard Frankensteen called a general strike against the Ford Motor Company and begin which they called 'Unionism, Not Fordism,'' demanding higher pay and less hours. At 2:00 PM today, a photographer from the Detroit Free Press asked to take a photo of the Leaders of the UAW standing on the overpass with the Ford sign in the background. While they were posing, 40 men with batons from the Ford's Service Department, an internal security force came from behind and began to beat them. The group then beat some of the beret-wearing women arriving to pass out leaflets."
  ustates.5.a:0 "This will hurt us more than it hurt the Unionists!"
  ustates.6.t:0 "The Great Heat Wave of '36"
  ustates.6.d:0 "A Heat Wave has struck the Continental United States and Canada, the most severe heat wave in the Modern History of North America. 'The Great Heat Wave' started in late June, went up over 100°F (38°C) as the Drought conditions worsened due to a lack of rain. Now, into July, the heat has reached all time records. In Steele, North Dakota, temperatures reached 121°F (50°C). In Ohio, temperatures reached 110°F (43°C), which was close to tying a record high set in 1934. It comes in a time of major political unrest, with the America First Council a major force in Midwest Politics, Socialist and Syndicalist mobs and militias are gathering arms in the Great Lakes region. The drought is continuing, and there have been over 3000 reported deaths. Many people are suffering from heat stroke, and heat exhaustion. Farmers across the continent saw their worst harvest on record, causing corn and wheat prices to rise quickly and this Heat Wave does not seem to be giving up any time soon."
  ustates.6.a:0 "This just isn't our year..."
  ustates.7.t:0 "The Great Heat Wave is Over"
  ustates.7.d:0 "People from Vancouver and Los Angeles to New York and Washington D.C. let out a sigh of relief as The Great Heat Wave of 1936 has come to and end in and a cold front has spread over North America. The estimated death toll reached 5,000 as the deadliest natural disaster of the 20th century in the United States comes to a close. But while the Heat Wave ends, a new Chapter in American history is about to begin."
  ustates.7.a:0 "At least it's over..."
  ustates.8.t:0 "The Golden Gate Bridge is Complete"
  ustates.8.d:0 "A Historic Day, The Golden Gate Bridge of San Francisco was completed by Joseph Strauss and his team of engineers.

The Golden Gate Bridge is the largest suspension bridge in the world and reporters and journalists from all over the World have come to the Grand Opening which will be held next week. The New Government of California, after having recently broken off from the United States of America has made this new bridge a symbol of it's government and its prosperity."

His body will be taken back to his hometown of Vilnius, Lithuania for his funeral. He was the leader of the Syndicalist movement in the Americas, and the movement suffers a major set-back with his depature."
  ustates.9.a:0 "The Anarcho-Syndicalist torch passes onto John 'Jack' Reed"
  ustates.10.t:0 "World premiere of Modern Times"
  ustates.10.d:0 "The premiere of Charlie Chaplin's new movie, Modern Times, is attended in New York by personalities such as Jack Reed, Marceau Pivert, and Philip Snowden, specially coming to the USA. The comedy film, featuring Chaplin's famous Little Tramp character, is seen as a anti-capitalist and anti-fordist manifesto in favor of the Combined Syndicates of America. After a few days, it is censored by the federal government, judged as too provocative a few months before the election."
  ustates.10.a:0 "So bad, it was so funny"
  ustates.11.t:0 "Vice-President Curtis recovers"
  ustates.11.d:0 "Many in America feared the worse when Vice President Charles Curtis, presumptive Republican nominee to succeed President Hoover, suffered a heart attack earlier in the morning. The White House finally announced that the Vice President was slowly recovering. If Curtis could be the first President of Native American ancestry, his poor health seems to be a dark omen for the end of the Hoover administration."
  ustates.11.a:0 "Let's hope he will have a good running mate"
  ustates.12.t:0 "The St. Patrick's Day Flood"
  ustates.12.d:0 "On March 16, 1936, warmer than normal temperatures led to the melting of snow and ice on the upper Allegheny and Monongahela rivers. These rivers and their tributaries were already over their banks and were threatening the city of Pittsburgh. On March 17, 1936 the waters reached flood stage of 25 feet. Heavy rains overnight caused the waters to rise quickly, and on March 18, the water peaked at about at 46 feet, 21 feet above flood stage."
  ustates.12.a:0 "We must help the people."
  ustates.12.b:0 "They will help themselves"
  ustates.13.t:0 "Fate of the Colorado river dam"
  ustates.13.d:0 "Prior to the 1936-1937 crisis, the construction works on a dam on the Colorado River along the Arizona/Nevada border, which started in 1932, had greatly progressed. With turbulent times finally behind us we have the time and resources to finish this project."
  ustates.13.a:0 "Complete the dam !"
  ustates.13.b:0 "We can't afront it"
  ustates.14.t:0 "The Colorado River Dam is Complete!"
  ustates.14.d:0 "It took several years, lots of money, and more than a few lives, but we have dammed the Colorado River. We can irrigate the surrounding areas, prevent floods, and generate enough power to supply almost the entire region!"
  ustates.14.a:0 "Hooray for the Boulder Dam!"
  ustates.14.b:0 "Hooray for the MacArthur Dam!"
  ustates.157.t:0 "The Constitutional Ban"
  ustates.157.d:0 "MacArthur was prepared for extreme action in dealing with both the America First Party and Combined Syndicates. He attacked both parties as being prepared to use the election to destroy the American constitution and thus prepared to pass an act to ban both the parties from participating in the election. The act would remove both the political parties from being legitimate entities and any action that they progressed with would be seen as an act of treason."
  ustates.157.a:0 "Pass the act."
  ustates.157.b:0 "We will have open elections."
  ustates.157.c:0 "Pass the Emergency Security Act."
  ustates.15.t:0 "The Crackdown"
  ustates.15.d:0 "After passing the act MacArthur moved to defeat the groups that had been causing the most problems for the country. He declared a nationwide crackdown against all movements were seen as being against American democracy. He was first concentrating in the east where both the America First and CSA were most prominent."
  ustates.15.a:0 "Crackdown on the CSA"
  ustates.15.b:0 "Crackdown on both"
  ustates.15.c:0 "Crackdown on the America First"
  ustates.16.t:0 "Crackdown on the CSA"
  ustates.16.d:0 "Government forces began moving through the streets of the northern United States disrupting CSA meetings and arresting leaders. Hundreds were arrested and there were several instances of violence. Reed called for a general strike in response to the action and the whole situation was threatening to devolve into chaos."
  ustates.16.a:0 "They run like rats!"
  ustates.17.t:0 "The General Strike"
  ustates.17.d:0 "The government crackdown had been successfull against the CSA but it had not deterred them. Reed called for a general strike and thousands of workers and unions joined them. The northern US came to a halt and the situation was dire."
  ustates.17.a:0 "Send the army in to end the strike!"
  ustates.17.b:0 "Negotiate with Reed"
  ustates.18.t:0 "The Army and CSA Clash"
  ustates.18.d:0 "When the army was deployed to end the general strike, they were attacked by militant members of the CSA. Reed called for calm but the clashes grew in intensity and soon full scale battles were being fought in the streets of America. Soon the unions of the north were barricading the streets and armed militias began to arrive to assist in the battles with the army."
  ustates.18.a:0 "They'll pay"
  ustates.19.t:0 "MacArthur and Reed"
  ustates.19.d:0 "MacArthur agreed to listen to Reed's requests in an attempt to resolve the dispute but the demands put forth were extreme. Reed demanded that the Emergency Security Act be withdrawn and all CSA members who were arrested released. It was unlikely that MacArthur would give in to such demands and if he did the country may explode."
  ustates.19.a:0 "Give in and hand over the prisoners to Reed."
  ustates.19.b:0 "Not a bloody chance"
  ustates.20.t:0 "Crackdown on the America First"
  ustates.20.d:0 "Government troops flooded into the south determined to destroy the America First. The America First was far more organized than MacArthur had realized and there were skirmishes between federal troops and the America First. MacArthur demanded Long disband his militia and formally disband the America First Party. Long was unwilling to do this saying that MacArthur was nothing more than a dictator and a puppet of the liberal conspirators in Washington."
  ustates.20.a:0 "Send in the FBI to arrest Long and the America First leadership"
  ustates.20.b:0 "Negotiate with Long"
  ustates.21.t:0 "FBI agents killed by Minute Men"
  ustates.21.d:0 "When the FBI attempted to arrest Long their agents were ambushed by a group of Minute Men. Several FBI men were killed and Long was able to escape harm. He accused MacArthur of trying to assassinate him and declared the regime of MacArthur an illegal government that he would no longer follow. Units of the southern states began to mobilize as Long rallied the people around the America First."
  ustates.21.a:0 "Long will be mine!"
  ustates.22.t:0 "MacArthur and Long"
  ustates.22.d:0 "Long requested that MacArthur allow the America First to operate under the guidance of administration. He told MacArthur that they were fighting the same enemies and the America First could be a great ally to him. MacArthur was suspicious of Long and knew not to trust the America First."
  ustates.22.a:0 "Let the America First go."
  ustates.22.b:0 "Not a chance"
  ustates.23.t:0 "Country Wide Crackdown"
  ustates.23.d:0 "MacArthur sent federal troops coast to coast to deal with both the CSA and the America First. The nation wide sweep led to the arrests of several America First and CSA leaders. Both Long and Reed denounced the crackdown as nothing more than an attempt to eradicate opposing views. Protests against the move were launched throughout the country and Reed was threatening a general strike. The America First attacked government officials and burned government buildings."
  ustates.23.a:0 "Declare Martial Law"
  ustates.23.b:0 "Pull out the troops"
  ustates.24.t:0 "Chaos in America"
  ustates.24.d:0 "With the withdrawal of his troops, MacArthur had lost control of the country and armed militia units were popping up to defy the United States "
  ustates.24.a:0 "Depose MacArthur"
  ustates.24.b:0 "He will pull through"
  ustates.25.t:0 "The Days of Violence"
  ustates.25.d:0 "The days leading up the election were marred by violence as both the America First and CSA protested their ban from the election. Anarchist groups attacked government buildings and America First supporters denounced the election as nothing more than a joke. While Reed and the CSA threatened a general strike if the election did not include them, the America First rallied around Long who used his position in the senate to demand his inclusion in the election."
  ustates.25.a:0 "The ban stands!"
