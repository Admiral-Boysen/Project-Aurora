 shanqing.1.t:0 "A like minded revolution"
 shanqing.1.d:0 "In Southern China a new revolution has erupted against those collaborating with the Germans. Although we may not agree on everything, It may be in our best interest to support this revolution and decide who truly rules China later!"
 shanqing.1.a:0 "China for the Chinese!"
 shanqing.1.b:0 "They are really no better than collaborators!"
 shanqing.2.t:0 "Fall of the Qing Empire"
 shanqing.2.d:0 "Our long-term friend and potential ally in China, the Qing Empire has fallen to the fanatic rebels who now fancy themselves as the true empire of China, however they are fast becoming a real threat to our colonial holdings in Eastern Asia. On the other hand our spies have saved Puyi who is eager for revenge, maybe we can work out a deal with the Japanese and weaken both Asian giants at the same time."
 shanqing.2.a:0 "Call Puyi and contact Japanese!"
 shanqing.2.b:0 "This is useless..."
 shanqing.3.t:0 "Offer from the German Empire"
 shanqing.3.d:0 "Today we received an interesting offer from Germany, they want to form a secret pact with us to counter rise of the new religious fanatics in China. The former emperor of Qing dynasty Puyi, who is currently in exile in German-held Qingdao, has officially pleaded for our support against the rebels. He might be more useful as the rightful leader of the Manchurian people than the shifty Zhang Zuolin who once betrayed us by siding with the Republic of China."
 shanqing.3.a:0 "Puyi would make a more willing puppet."
 shanqing.3.b:0 "This is useless..."
 shanqing.4.t:0 "Death of Zhang Zuolin"
 shanqing.4.d:0 "Terrible news, our leader Zhang Zuolin and his eldest son Zhang Xueliang died in a train accident at the outskirts of Shenyang. Following the accident, the chaos was used by to justify a Japanese intervention with the backing of Germany to restore order and use the opportunity to declare the former emperor of Qing, Puyi, as the rightful ruler of Manchuria and its people."
 shanqing.4.a:0 "How could this happen..."
 shanqing.5.t:0 "Great Empire of Manchuria"
 shanqing.5.d:0 "With the help of the Germans and the Japanese the rule of Manchu Dynasty was able to reestablished in their homeland. We are confident that soon the time will come for revenge against the rebels in the south!"
 shanqing.5.a:0 "Rebirth of the Manchu Empire!"
 shanqing.6.t:0 "Rebirth of the Qing"
 shanqing.6.d:0 "Word has reached us that after evading capture by the Revolutionary Army the former Qing emperor Puyi has managed to rebuild his little empire in Manchuria, declaring himself Emperor of Manchuria after the Japanese Empire managed to remove the shifty warlord Zhang Zuolin of Fengtien through nefarious means. The continual Japanese presence on Chinese soil alone offends the will of Heaven, maybe it's time for us to finish the job and evict the foreigners from Manchuria?"
 shanqing.6.a:0 "Puyi won't be able to escape this time!"
 shanqing.6.b:0 "We are not ready to face Japan..."
 shanqing.7.t:0 "Revolution in the South"
 shanqing.7.d:0 "With our recent victory over the pathetic Qing Empire, we now must find ways to continue driving the foreigners out of China! Word has it that there are like-minded individuals in Southern China, maybe if we supported their revolution..."
 shanqing.7.a:0 "Fund another revolution!"
 shanqing.7.b:0 "Leave them be, they cannot be trusted"
 shanqing.8.t:0 "Our Brothers have taken up arms!"
 shanqing.8.d:0 "Through our smuggling of weapons and supplies we have been able to instigate a revolt in Southern China. Let us remove the German presence forever!"
 shanqing.8.a:0 "Our efforts pay off"
 shanqing.9.t:0 "War in the South"
 shanqing.9.d:0 "Yunnan and the German-led AoG have gone to war with each other. The foreign menace seeks to expand and subjugate even more good Chinese people. We should stop them! Save what we can and fight the Germans however possible."
 shanqing.9.a:0 "We must take action, send troops south"
 shanqing.9.b:0 "We are in no position to act"
 shanqing.10.t:0 "China is Chinese and now it needs one Government!"
 shanqing.10.d:0 "We, together with the Republican movement, have thrown the corruption of the foreigners out of our lands. Now we must unite and carry China onwards forever!"
 shanqing.10.a:0 "Press for unity"
 shanqing.10.b:0 "Our alliance shall stand!"
 shanqing.11.t:0 "The Shangqing are pressing for a united China"
 shanqing.11.d:0 "The Shangqing have decided that they alone should rule China, but our differences are great and many of our people do not wish to join them"
 shanqing.11.a:0 "We refuse - push for twin governments"
 shanqing.11.b:0 "Accept to exist under their rule"
 shanqing.11.c:0 "Agree, but remain semi-autonomous"
 shanqing.11.e:0 "One Government, One Religion"
 shanqing.12.t:0 "The Republicans have refused to accept the Mandate of Heaven!"
 shanqing.12.d:0 "The Republicans have obviously been too influenced by the foreign powers, we must remove their stain as well!"
 shanqing.12.a:0 "Enfore the Mandate!"
 shanqing.12.b:0 "Let the alliance stand, we are united enough"
 shanqing.13.t:0 "Unity for China!"
 shanqing.13.d:0 "The Republican government has accepted our push for the total unification of our countries. This is a great day for all of China!"
 shanqing.13.a:0 "Bring them into the fold!"
 shanqing.14.t:0 "Automony?"
 shanqing.14.d:0 "The Republicans have decided to follow us if we let the Republic be autonomous."
 shanqing.14.a:0 "Accept"
 shanqing.14.b:0 "Fools, We have the Mandate!"
 shanqing.15.t:0 "One Government, One Religion"
 shanqing.15.d:0 "The Republican Government is offering us complete spiritual control, while they control the government"
 shanqing.15.a:0 "Accept"
 shanqing.15.b:0 "Fools, We have the Mandate!"
 shanqing.16.t:0 "The Shangqing have accepted!"
 shanqing.16.d:0 "The Shangqing have accepted our offer aimed at unification of our countries. This is a glorious day for FREE CHINA!"
 shanqing.16.a:0 "Victory and Peace!"
 shanqing.16.t:0 "A New Home for The Path of Consistence"
 shanqing.17.d:0 "With the ousting of the Manchurian Qing dynasty from Peking and the ascendency of Shanqing supremacy over all Chinese lands between the Yellow and Yangtze rivers, enforcing the Mandate from Yan'an has become somewhat cumbersome. Perhaps it is time for The Pure Kingdom Upon the Heavens to find a new administrative nucleus?"
 shanqing.17.a:0 "In honour of Hong Xiuquan, onwards to Nanjing!"
 shanqing.17.b:0 "Install the Mandate in the Forbidden City!"
 shanqing.17.c:0 "Yan'an actually does have its charms..."
 shanqing.17.t:0 "The AoG has been defeated"
 shanqing.18.d:0 "The AOG has succumbed to our might. Where others have failed, we have prevailed! South China stands united and free, guided by the heavenly light of I-Kuan-Tao! Our victory even inspired some former underground revolutionaries to join our ranks. May those German pigs and their running dogs never despoil our sacred realms again!"
 shanqing.18.a:0 "Huzzah! Wansui, wansui!"
 shanqing.19.t:0 "Yunnan has been defeated!"
 shanqing.19.d:0 "Our brothers of the Southwest have been liberated from that godless warlord scum Long Yun! Enthusiastic volunteers and former soldiers of the clique, having seen the error of their ways, have joined us."
 shanqing.19.a:0 "How great is the way of Heaven!"
 shanqing.20.t:0 "Fengtien has been defeated"
 shanqing.20.d:0 "The Northeast has been taken by our heavenly host! That bandit and traitor emperor-wannabe Zhang Zuolin is history now, as is his clique! He was just like the Overlord of Chu, cruelty and arrogance led to a well-deserved downfall. The people, delivered from their plight, are flocking to Our Great Teacher's cause."
 shanqing.20.a:0 "Excellent"
 shanqing.21.t:0 "Our great teacher has died!"
 shanqing.21.d:0 "Zhang Tianran, our great teacher that has lead us for so long, has died! The Leadership has become divided on who is to succed our Great Teacher between Sun Suzhen and Zhang Guotao. Who will lead our nation?"
 shanqing.21.a:0 "Sun Suzhen will now guide our people!"
 shanqing.21.b:0 "Zhang Guotao will now guide our people!"
 shanqing.22.t:0 "Zhang Tianran has died!"
