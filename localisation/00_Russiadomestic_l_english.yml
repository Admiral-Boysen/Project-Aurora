rusd.4.d:0  "Throughout Russian history the peasants' living conditions has always been hard, even during periods of peace and prosperity.

rusd.8.c:0 "Send the army to pacify them!"

rusd.10.b:0 "No, we must not be too harsh."
rusd.11.t:0 "The strikers give up!"
rusd.11.d:0 "The slow war of attrition between us and the strikers has been won by the government. The workers, seeing little success in their efforts, are about to call off the strike."

rusd.12.d:0 "With the crisis resolved the factories may return to their previous efficiency."
rusd.12.a:0 "Excellent!"
rusd.13.t:0 "General strike"
rusd.13.d:0 "Workers organisations all over the Russia have reached an agreement and decided to call for a general strike.

rusd.40.t:0 "The patriarch criticises the government"
rusd.40.d:0 "Seeing increased displeasure amongst the common people the patriarch has decided to voice his concern about the increasing secularisation of our state.

rusd.46.d:0 "A large scale celebration has taken place is our capital. Apart from thousands of common Russians, the Patriarch, members of the Romanov family and dozens of nobles, politicians and high-ranking officers have attended the mass.

rusd.48.a:0 "Let them shout!"
rusd.50.t:0 "The Prime Minister Addresses the Duma"
rusd.50.d:0 "After Kerensky's assassination the country is still in chaos.

rusd.65.e:0 "Nikolai Bukharin, Only Bolshevism can lead us to freedom!"
rusd.66.t:0 "SR-Menshevik coalition breaks up"
rusd.66.d:0 "Kerensky's death meant that the fragile SR-Kadet coalition was no more. Even though the SR-Menshevik coalition has resulted in the two parties gaining considerable influence on the government ideological differences between the two parties were too great to maintain a coherent coalition, resulting in the Mensheviks leaving the government. This gives way to great possibilities, including a Menshevik-Bolshevik coalition in the near future."
rusd.66.a:0 "Let the Reds quarrel!"
rusd.66.b:0 "Oh no!"
rusd.67.t:0 "Splintering within the conservatives"
rusd.67.d:0 "Dmitri Romanov's authority and charisma was one of the few things that kept the Russian conservatives strong and vibrant. With his death the movement quickly split into two branches; the so-called Siloviki, organised around marshal Denikin and consisting mostly of White military officers, and the conservative civilians, gathered around professor Nikolai Trubetskoy. Without his protector Yusupov was quickly replaced by Trubetskoy."

rusd.76.d:0 "According to the Constitution elections are to be held every five years. The IX Duma's term has expired and the time has come to elect a new parliament.

rusd.76.a:0 "Dissolve the Duma and place loyal officers in the Army!"
rusd.76.b:0 "Compromise with the Mensheviks and SR."
rusd.76.c:0 "The Kadets, liberals, and royalists overthrow the Bolsheviks!"

rusd.96.t:0 "Anton Denikin dies"
rusd.96.d:0 "A hero of the Civil War and the informal leader of Russian conservatives, Anton Ivanovich Denikin, died yesterday in his manor. Although never as radical as his counterpart, Baron Wrangel, Denikin's influence throughout Russia was hard to overestimate. A week of national mourning has been declared as the people bade farewell to one of the few true heroes of Russia. Grand Admiral Vasily Kanin has been selected to replace him as the head of the Siloviki."
rusd.96.a:0 "Goodbye, Denikin"
rusd.96.b:0 "Even the strongest die one day!"
rusd.97.t:0 "Boris Sturmer dies"
rusd.97.d:0 "One of the most experienced politicians in Russia, Boris Sturmer, has passed away due to a heart attack upon hearing the news of Kerensky's assasination.
