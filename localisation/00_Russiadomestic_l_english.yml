rusd.8.t:0 "Workers strike"
rusd.8.d:0  "Some workers in one of our cities have organised themselves and begun a strike, completely disrupting all industrial production coming from the city. They demand higher salaries and an enforcement of labour legislation preventing unfair treatment of the workforce."

rusd.8.c:0 "Send the army to pacify them!"
rusd.9.t:0 "Negotiating with the strikers"

rusd.10.b:0 "No, we must not be too harsh."
rusd.11.t:0 "The strikers give up!"

rusd.13.t:0 "General strike"
rusd.13.d:0 "Workers organisations all over the Russia have reached an agreement and decided to call for a general strike.
