rusd.4.t:0 "Peasant unrest"
rusd.4.d:0  "Throughout Russian history the peasants' living conditions has always been hard, even during periods of peace and prosperity.

Local peasant protests against these harsh conditions, as well as landowners' illegal actions, were common."
rusd.4.a:0 "Oh well..."
rusd.5.t:0 "Agitation in the countryside"
rusd.5.d:0 "With the situation in the countryside growing increasingly unstable the peasants became easy to influence by various agitators. One such situation has recently taken place; a charismatic activist visited a number of villages calling for open revolt against our regime. How should we react to this potential threat?"
rusd.5.a:0 "Let him agitate, we have more important business."
rus.5.b:0 "Eliminate the agitator!"
rusd.6.t:0 "Major peasant unrest"
rusd.6.d:0 "Agitated by various groups the impoverished peasantry has risen up. The local administration is powerless against the mob and it seems that the only way to solve the crisis is to use force. Alternatively we can always attempt to negotiate, although satisfying the peasants' demands may turn out to be quite expensive."
rusd.6.a:0 "Send the army to eliminate the threat!"
rusd.6.b:0 "Attempt to negotiate and fulfill some demands."
rusd.6.c:0 "Fully agree to the peasants' demands."
rusd.7.t:0 "Workers' demonstration"
rusd.7.d:0 "Even though technological advancement resulted in a slow but steady improvement of working conditions the workers remained very vulnerable to Socialist agitation. Demonstrations in cities were organised from time to time, their demands varying depending on who was pulling the strings."
rusd.7.a:0 "Oh well..."
rusd.8.t:0 "Workers strike"
rusd.8.d:0  "Some workers in one of our cities have organised themselves and begun a strike, completely disrupting all industrial production coming from the city. They demand higher salaries and an enforcement of labour legislation preventing unfair treatment of the workforce."
rusd.8.a:0 "Fulfill their demands."
rusd.8.b:0 "Ignore their demands."
rusd.8.c:0 "Send the army to pacify them!"
rusd.9.t:0 "Negotiating with the strikers"
rusd.9.d:0 "An attempt to negotiate with the striking workers has been made. All political forces in the country closely watch the meeting, some are hoping that the strike will become an impulse for further reforms in Russia."
rusd.9.a:0 "Stall the negotiations."
rusd.9.b:0 "Reach an agreement but implement only small reforms."
rusd.9.c:0 "Reach a complete agreement."
rusd.10.t:0 "Harsh measures"
rusd.10.d:0 "The commander of a local army garrison has proposed that we use brute force in order to disperse the strikers and force them to go back to work."
rusd.10.a:0 "Why not? It's quicker than those negotiations!"
rusd.10.b:0 "No, we must not be too harsh."
rusd.11.t:0 "The strikers give up!"
rusd.11.d:0 "The slow war of attrition between us and the strikers has been won by the government. The workers, seeing little success in their efforts, are about to call off the strike."
rusd.11.a:0 "Splendid!"
rusd.12.t:0 "The factory returns to work"
rusd.12.d:0 "With the crisis resolved the factories may return to their previous efficiency."
rusd.12.a:0 "Excellent!"
