 ENG_tuc:0 "The Congress of the Trade Unions"
 ENG_tuc_desc:0 "The 1936 TUC Congress has been opened with much fanfare. This is the most important political event of the year, as it is now that new ministers are appointed and (although it is not explicitly mentioned) changes in Union policy are made and announced. This years congress will probably be a bit special though. Long-time TUC chairman Philip Snowden has long indicated that he intends to withdraw following this congress, and the stakes are high. Rivalling factions are forming behind the curtains, and the decentralizationist Authonomists, led by Niclas y Glais, centralizationist Maximists (Oswald Mosley), status quo socialist Federationists (Arthur Horner) and radical egalitarian paci-isolationist Congregationalists (Annie Kenney) are all wying for superiority in the TUC. Whatever the outcome, this will surely be a thing to remember..."

Noone is really sure who will triumph in this debate. Will the decentralization message of the Autonomists take the day or will the Maximist centralization message trounce the opposition? Or will perhaps the more vague arguments by Federationists and Congregationalists emerge victorious?"

 ENG_finish_rns_rebecca_desc:0 "With newest aircraft carrier RNS Rebecca fully operational, the Republican Navy was ready to reclaim her rightful position among the mightiest navies of the world. However, target of her first action was heavily disputed. Most officers opted for a full scale naval demonstration near Ireland or even further westwards - near Azores or Iceland. But naval manouvers of such large scale would surely drawn attention of much powerfull and heavily armed Hochseeflotte and even a smaller Canadian Royal navy might be forced to organize countermeasure against our manouvers . Less radical ones and most of members of the Congress of Trade Unions, opted for a small scale manouvers, possibly without leaving British territorial waters. Ultimately the Naval Commisar was inclined in favour for the Irish option."
