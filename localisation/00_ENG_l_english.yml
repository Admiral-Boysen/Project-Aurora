 # Intro Screen
 ENG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The British people are currently secure on their island, content to build socialism in political and economic isolation, protected by the strong Republican Air Force and Navy, and with each county protected by its own popular militia who act both as a reserve military and the new police constabularies. Yet, with the world seemingly ready to erupt into chaos, many are starting to wonder if Britain has a duty to spread the revolution to her former colonial territories. After all, the Monarchists in Canada cannot be allowed to plot against the Union indefinitely..."

 ENG_tuc:0 "The Congress of the Trade Unions"
 ENG_tuc_desc:0 "The 1936 TUC congress has been opened with much fanfare. This is the most important political event of the year, as it is now that new ministers are appointed and (although it is not explicitly mentioned) changes in Union policy are made and announced. This years congress will probably be a bit special though. Long-time TUC chairman Philip Snowden has long indicated that he intends to withdraw following this congress, and the stakes are high. Rivalling factions are forming behind the curtains, and the decentralizationist Authonomists, led by Niclas y Glais, centralizationist Maximists (Oswald Mosley), status quo socialist Federationists (Arthur Horner) and radical egalitarian paci-isolationist Congregationists (Annie Kenney) are all wying for superiority in the TUC. Whatever the outcome, this will surely be a thing to remember..."
 ENG_tuc_econmy:0 "Economic Policy"
 ENG_tuc_economy_desc:0 "On this fifth day of the TUC congress, the debate has wandered into the area of economics. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. Most people assume that the Maximists will win this debate, since Oswald Mosley is a major figure in the British economy these days."
 ENG_tuc_internal:0 "Internal Policy"
 ENG_tuc_internal_desc:0 "On this tenth day of the TUC congress, the debate has wandered into the area of internal policy. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. Noone is really sure who will triumph in this debate. Will the decentralization message of the Autonomists take the day or will the Maximist centralization message trounce the opposition? Or will perhaps the more vague arguments by Federationists and Congregationists emerge victorious?"
 ENG_tuc_military:0 "Military Affairs"
 ENG_tuc_military_desc:0 "On this fifteenth day of the TUC congress, the debate has wandered into the area of military affairs. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The debate is heated, since the last few days have only too clearly shown the deep rift within the TUC."
 ENG_tuc_foreign:0 "Foreign Policy"
 ENG_tuc_foreign_desc:0 "On this twentieth day of the TUC congress, the debate has wandered into the area of foreign policy. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The congress listened casually to every candidate until the suggestion of the Autonomists were heard, when a slow, shocked murmur ran through the hall."
 ENG_third_international:0 "The Third International"
 ENG_third_international_desc:0 "France has gone through with its designs to hold the First congress of the Third International and we, as expected, have received an invitation. It would be foolish not to send a delegation."
 ENG_finish_rns_rebecca:0 "Finish building the RNS Rebecca"
 ENG_finish_rns_rebecca_desc:0 "With newest aircraft carrier RNS Rebecca fully operational, the Republican Navy was ready to reclaim her rightful position among the mightiest navies of the world. However, target of her first action was heavily disputed. Most officers opted for a full scale naval demonstration near Ireland or even further westwards - near Azores or Iceland. But naval manouvers of such large scale would surely drawn attention of much powerfull and heavily armed Hochseeflotte and even a smaller Canadian Royal navy might be forced to organize countermeasure against our manouvers . Less radical ones and most of members of the congress of Trade Unions, opted for a small scale manouvers, possibly without leaving British territorial waters. Ultimately the Naval Commisar was inclined in favour for the Irish option."
