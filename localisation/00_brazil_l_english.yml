### Event text ###
 bra.1.t:0 "The Political Situation"
 bra.1.d:0 "Brazil's fragile First Republic has been on the brink of its end since her humiliating defeat by Argentina on last year's war. The apparent stability represented by the 'Café com Leite' doctrine - the dominance of Brazilian politics by the landed oligarchies of São Paulo and Minas Gerais - is revealing itself a farse, as general dissent against the federal government becomes more and more apparent. Old rivalries between different sectors of society are awaken. Unsatisfaction by the local elites of the South and Northeast against the government in Rio, and also by the industrialists in São Paulo, is growing. The 'cangaço' bandits, led by figures like Lampião and Corisco, are running rampant and harassing farmers in Ceará, Bahia and Pernambuco. The Brazilian Workers Confederation, an umbrella organization for the syndicalist movement, is sponsoring heavy labor strikes in the South-Southeast. Meanwhile, populist and nationalist thoughts are growing amongst the army and the middle class. Not even the armed forces can be trusted anymore: the 'Tenentes', the nonpartisan junior officers who organized the mutinies amongst the Army during the final stages of the war, can - and will - be mobilized by any side of the political spectrum. Emergency elections have been called for August, and some say that only a miracle can save democracy in Brazil."
 bra.1.a:0 "Let us wait until August, then."
 bra.2.t:0 "Padre Cícero passes away."
 bra.2.d:0 "This morning, father Cícero Romão Batista, died peacefully during his sleep at the old age of 92. The local leader, revered as a saint by the peasantry of the northeastern states, was seen as an éminence grise by the political class in Ceará, acting as a neutral mediating party on disputes between the Coronéis, the landed oligarchs of the northeast."
 bra.2.a:0 "His charisma will be missed."
 bra.3.t:0 "The Brazilian Communist Party dissolves itself"
 bra.3.d:0 "This morning, the small city of Cruzeiro, São Paulo, was visited by the remaining leaders of the Brazilian Communist Party (PCB, Partido Comunista Brasileiro) as they organized their clandestine IV Party Congress. Founded in 1922 and much present on the very early days of the labour movement, the PCB is now a shadow of its former self, as a great part of its leaders and members have moved to other movements and parties, such as the Workers and Peasants Bloc (BOC, Bloco Operário e Camponês), the Brazilian Workers' Confederation (CBT, Confederação Brasileira dos Trabalhadores) and the Socialist Revolutionary Party (PSR, Partido Socialista Revolucionário). The strict adherence to the old Soviet Bolshevist doctrine by the party inner circle is seen by most as the main reason for its failure. With this in mind, the rump party voted by a great majority to dissolve itself and be absorved by the CBT. A small part of the old guard, however, led by Octávio Brandão, is keeping an eye on the developments of the Totalist ideas in Britain, and have already announced that the Party may be refounded on the near future."
 bra.3.a:0 "Ok."
 bra.4.t:0 "Major industrial strike in São Paulo"
 bra.4.d:0 "Today the Brazilian Workers Confederation, led by Astrogildo Pereira, announced a major strike in São Paulo. All the industry has stopped producing as most of the city's workers have joined the movement. The picketers are demanding a complete review of the labour laws, instituting a common minimal wage for all states and other workers rights. The organization is willing to negotiate starting now."
 bra.4.a:0 "Cave in to their demands."
 bra.4.b:0 "We will not negotiate with them unless they stop their strike."
 bra.4.c:0 "They are simply bandits, send in the police."
 bra.5.t:0 "CBT strike in São Paulo continues"
 bra.5.d:0 "The main industrial hub of the country is still on a complete halt as the Brazilian Workers Confederation mantains their picketing. The movement now is threathening to spread west to Rio de Janeiro, as the local CBT chapter led by Minervino de Oliveira has already announced their intent to join in. Some in the government say that we can't be held ransom by syndicalist scum and recommend a heavy police action."
 bra.5.a:0 "We can't risk an escalation, negotiate with the syndicates."
 bra.5.b:0 "Send in the police, the army and everything we have!"
 bra.elections.1.t:0 "Brazilian Presidential Election, 1936"
 bra.elections.1.desc:0 "Due to the unstable political situation in our country, specially after our defeat on the Platine War, emergency elections have been called for the 1st of August. Four main coalitions are disputing: first, we have the Aliança Nacional Libertadora (ANL, National Liberation Alliance), a broad front for the left-wing parties, composed of the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the political sides of the BOC and CBT syndicates. Next, we have the Liberal-Democrats (Liberal-Democratas), an ad-hoc coalition of center-left and liberal forces under former president Júlio Prestes, politically-experienced and presenting themselves as a moderate alternative to the present situation. Further to the right we have the Republicans (Republicanos), an union of conservative parties, joining landowners and industrial capitalists with the right-wing forces of the military under the leadership of populist Getúlio Vargas. The fourth main coalition are the authoritarian Brazilian Integralist Action (AIB, Ação Integralista Brasileira), the nationalist and populist party under Plínio Salgado. After a very passionate campaign, the elections took place today. As the votes were counted, the next President of Brazil was announced..."
 bra.elections.1.a:0 "Aliança Nacional Libertadora - Edgard Leuenroth"
 bra.elections.1.b:0 "Liberal-Democratas - Júlio Prestes"
 bra.elections.1.c:0 "Republicanos - Getúlio Vargas"
 bra.elections.1.d:0 "Ação Integralista Brasileira - Plínio Salgado"
 bra.elections.2.t:0 "Edgard Leuenroth inaugurated as President"
 bra.elections.2.d:0 "Despite all of the setbacks we have suffered on the previous years, the Aliança Nacional Libertadora grand coalition has managed to elect Edgard Frederico Leuenroth, of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, as the next president of Brazil. The fifty-five year old journalist and long-time anarchist was one of the organizers of the general strikes in São Paulo in 1917-1919, helping establish the anarcho-syndicalist movement in the country. He was seen, thus, by the ANL leadership, as their obvious candidate for the presidency. And today is his inauguration day! Despite what some purists think, we may be forced to work on a coalition with some left-wing elements of Liberal-Democrats to appease some parts of the middle classes. A much more palatable solution for us would be asking the left-wing Tenentes into our coalition. Others, however, still think we can handle the whole government all by ourselves."
 bra.elections.2.a:0 "Ask for support from the Liberal-Democratas."
 bra.elections.2.b:0 "Invite the left-wing Tenentes into the ANL."
 bra.elections.2.c:0 "The syndicalist movement needs no alliances."
 bra.elections.3.t:0 "The new Chief Minister"
 bra.elections.3.d:0 "At least until we enact a new constitution, the President of Brazil acts as Head of State, although real power must be shared with his Chief Minister of the Presidency (Ministro-Chefe da Casa Civil). He is responsible for assisting the President, overseeing all cabinet requests and bureaucratic procedures involving the Presidency, and is also responsible for negotiations with the state governments, with both houses of the Congress and with the remaining Ministers. All the three main parties of the ANL have put forward their own candidates for the post. Lívio Xavier of the BOC, Astrogildo Pereira of the CBT, and João da Costa Pimenta of the PSR. So, who shall we choose?"
 bra.elections.3.a:0 "Lívio Xavier"
 bra.elections.3.b:0 "Astrogildo Pereira"
 bra.elections.3.c:0 "João da Costa Pimenta"
 bra.elections.4.t:0 "Júlio Prestes returns to the presidency"
 bra.elections.4.d:0 "We were assured that the Brazilian people still believes on democracy. Júlio Prestes, president from 1930 to 1934, will return to office. Despite all the mess which has been brought to the country by the incompetence of the present government and by extremists from the right and left, the very institutions upon which the Federative Republic has been laid down were not shaken. And we know democracy is all about negotiating and laying alliances, right? Some parts of our bloc believe in asking the center-left elements of the military into our coalition, which will appease the armed forces. Others, however, think that inviting Getúlio Vargas and his Republicans would calm down the landowners and other conservative forces. So, what shall we choose?"
 bra.elections.4.a:0 "Form a coalition government with the center-left Tenentes."
 bra.elections.4.b:0 "Invite Getúlio!"
 bra.elections.4.c:0 "Our coalition needs no alliances."
 bra.elections.5.t:0 "The next Chief Minister"
 bra.elections.5.d:0 "Although the President of Brazil acts as Head of State, real power must be shared with his Chief Minister of the Presidency (Ministro-Chefe da Casa Civil). He is responsible for assisting the President, overseeing all cabinet requests and bureaucratic procedures involving the Presidency, and is also responsible for negotiations with the state governments, with both houses of the Congress and with the remaining Ministers. Our bloc has put forward three different candidates for the post. Washington Luís, president from 1926 to 1930, supported Júlio Prestes both on his 1930 campaign and on this year, so he would be a most likely choice. Two other candidates must also be considered, however: former Piauí governor Olímpio de Melo and Borges de Medeiros, the traditional gaúcho politician. Choosing a chief of staff from a smaller state, instead of the paulista Washington Luís, would grant us a greater support base among the traditionalist classes, altough we will miss the former president's political expertise."
 bra.elections.5.a:0 "Washington Luís"
 bra.elections.5.b:0 "Olímpio de Melo"
 bra.elections.5.c:0 "Borges de Medeiros"
 bra.elections.6.t:0 "Getúlio Vargas assumes the presidency"
 bra.elections.6.d:0 "Tradition has scored a victory. The people of Brazil has chosen Getúlio Vargas of the Republican bloc as the new president. Coming from a traditional rancher family of the southern Pampas, Vargas was seen by his coalition as a compromise candidate, appeasing the landowners from the South, Southeast and Northeast, the industrial bourgeoisie and, thanks to him states rights platform, the whole range of conservative forces. Plus, his populist speeches also seduced a portion of the proletariat, thanks to his promises of new labour laws and a more efficient social security system. Now, for a even more effective governing of Brazil, we must consider some political alliances with the other voting blocs. Should Vargas attempt a deal with the right-wing Tenentes led by Eurico Gaspar Dutra, his old friend from his time on the army? Some, however, are dreaming about a coalition with the nationalist Ação Integralista Brasileira. Despite the obvious differences between the pro-states rights Republicanos and the autoritharian AIB, some of their policies are perfectly compatible with ours. Plus, this would mean a greater support from the middle classes."
 bra.elections.6.a:0 "Invite the right-wing Tenentistas under Dutra."
 bra.elections.6.b:0 "Try a deal with Plínio Salgado's Integralists."
 bra.elections.6.c:0 "Do nothing - We can run everything by ourselves."
 bra.elections.7.t:0 "The next Chief Minister"
 bra.elections.7.d:0 "In Brazil, at least until we enact a new constitution, the President acts as Head of State, although real power must be shared with his Chief Minister of the Presidency (Ministro-Chefe da Casa Civil). He is responsible for assisting the President, overseeing all cabinet requests and bureaucratic procedures involving the Presidency, and is also responsible for negotiations with the state governments, with the ministers and with both houses of the Congress. Our bloc has put forward three different candidates for the post. Former governor of São Paulo, Altino Arantes, would surelly appease the industrialist classes and the coffee breeders of the state. Another good choice would be Eurico Gaspar Dutra, Vargas old friend from the army and one of the few succesfull leaders of the war against Argentina. Finally, if we want to please the oligarchs from the Northeast, Paraíba governor João Pessoa would be the ideal candidate."
 bra.elections.7.a:0 "Altino Arantes"
 bra.elections.7.b:0 "Eurico Gaspar Dutra"
 bra.elections.7.c:0 "João Pessoa"
 bra.elections.8.t:0 "Plínio Salgado is the new President"
 bra.elections.8.d:0 "The people of Brazil has chosen a change - Plínio Salgado is the new president! No more politics will be dominated by the interests of a small ruling class! We are also fed up of harassing by the syndicalist bandits! This decadent and unpopular government will be rebuilt from scratch according to our ideology. However, it would be wise to form a coalition government with like-minded politicians... Inviting the more far-right elements of the armed forces would be a nice move, according to some. Others, however, believe in striking a deal with Getúlio Vargas' Republicans - their populist ideas actually match several points of our own agenda!"
 bra.elections.8.a:0 "Invite the hardline Tenentes"
 bra.elections.8.b:0 "Try a deal with Getúlio"
 bra.elections.8.c:0 "The Integralists will head the government alone"
 bra.elections.9.t:0 "The next Chief Minister"
 bra.elections.9.d:0 "At least until we enact a new constitution, the President of Brazil acts as Head of State, although real power must be shared with his Chief Minister of the Presidency (Ministro-Chefe da Casa Civil). He is responsible for assisting the President, overseeing all cabinet requests and bureaucratic procedures involving the Presidency, and is also responsible for negotiations with the state governments, with the ministers and with both houses of the Congress. The AIB has put forward two different candidates for the post. The party's favourite is Gustavo Barroso, the political theorist responsible for much of the Integralist doctrine. Another option would be Euclides Figueiredo, the former army colonel."
 bra.elections.9.a:0 "Gustavo Barroso"
 bra.elections.9.b:0 "Euclides Figueiredo"
 bra.6.t:0 "Berlin crisis is approaching Brazil"
 bra.6.d:0 "Brazil was hit hard by the Berlin Stock Market Crash, as the country has a heavy dependence on foreign markets and loans. Despite the industrial development in São Paulo, the export of coffee and other primary products is still the mainstay of the economy. Days after the Berlin stock market crash, coffee quotations immediately fell 30 percent. Now, while we still are the government of Brazil, we must take a decision. Sticking to the principles preached by the foreign bankers may preserve our economy from some of the worse effects of the crisis, but will anger the people even more. However, suspending the convertibility of the Real and the Papiermark would be disastrous for our economy and foreign trade."
 bra.7.t:0 "Effects of the Berlin crisis"
 bra.7.d:0 "Following the Berlin panic, the Brazilian government has decided to stick to its policies of pleasing foreign creditors by maintaining convertibility according to the principles defended by the European and North American bankers who set the terms for our country's relations with the world economy. These acts have left the regime even more alienated from just about every segment of society."
 bra.8.t:0 "Bank panic!"
 bra.8.d:0 "Due to our horrible decision of suspending convertibility of the Real, a huge part of the middle classes and industrialists are running to the banks and withdrawing their deposits fearing the bankruptcy of these institutions. Many economists are now fearing even greater effects of the Berlin crisis in Brazil."
 bra.9.t:0 "The Economy Recorvers"
 bra.9.d:0 "Brazil's economy has finally recovered from the backlash of the Berlin crisis. Our economists are saying that the worse is now behind us and Brazil can again look for a better future."
 bra.10.t:0 "Agricultural Crisis"
 bra.10.d:0 "We will now face our first challenge: how to deal with the current economical crisis? Our cabinet believes that the first steps must be taken on the fields. Since the beggining of the Berlin panic, world demand for our agricultural products has fallen dramatically, and the grand landowners (mainly the sugar and coffee barons) are struck with unsellable harvests. Soon more and more poor peasants will either starve or look for better opportunities in the cities, while the landowners will take the opportunity to blame the federal government for not helping them out of the mess. We could use this opportunity to initiate a broad land reform programme, but the landowners (especially the northeastern coronéis) would of course raise their voices."
 bra.11.t:0 "Liberal-Democratas protest against the land reform"
 bra.11.d:0 "Upon hearing about the planned land reform programmes, Chief Minister Borges de Medeiros rushed to the Palácio do Catete to demand explanations! He and the other Liberal-Democratas on the government see these programmes as an affront to the right to private property. Now, should we honor the will of the Brazilian workers and peasants who voted for us, or should we respect our coalition partners?"
 bra.12.t:0 "The Second Coluna Prestes"
 bra.12.d:0 "Two years ago, as the war against Argentina was still ongoing and the first mutinies were ecloding, Luís Carlos Prestes led a batallion of some two hundred like-minded officers and corporals away from the frontlines. Influenced by syndicalist ideals, the group spent the following years travelling across Brazil on horseback, speaking to the crowds about the futility of the war and spreading the word of social justice, while also fleeing from chasing police, army regulars and, specially in the northeastern states, from paramilitary units of jagunços, the coronéis' thugs. The 'Prestes Column', as the group came to be known, camped from January to September 1935 on the hinterlands of Bahia, Pernambuco, Paraíba, Ceará and Piauí, seeing with their own eyes the harsh and miserable life of the poor sertanejo peasants, a chapter of our recent history that is seen as the birth of the left-tenentista movement. Now, as the syndicalist government of Brazil has announced their plans for an extensive land reform programme, Prestes has offered his services to us and will lead a new two-months-long survey mission to Bahia and Ceará, thus helping the comission to better implement their new policies and adapt them to the regional necessities."
 bra.13.t:0 "The Second Coluna Prestes"

Now, as the syndicalist government of Brazil has announced their plans for an extensive land reform programme, Prestes, currently our Chief Minsiter, has offered his intention of leading a new two-months-long survey mission to Bahia and Ceará, thus helping the comission to better implement their new policies and adapt them to the regional necessities. However, Prestes needs our approval before departing on this new adventure."
 bra.14.t:0 "The Second Coluna Prestes and the Cangaço"
 bra.14.d:0 "Today, the 'Prestes Column' approached the city of Juazeiro, Ceará, where they were greeted on the outskirts of the city by a band of a few dozen cangaceiros under the command of Lampião, so-called the 'King of Cangaço'. On their constant fighting against the landowners' thugs, sometimes for their own personal glory, sometimes for a sincere protection of the poorer peasants, labeled either as heroes or bandits, the cangaceiros are an integral part of the complex social-political landscape of the northeastern states. One of the column's members, a devoted Marxist of the PSR, lectured both the Coluna and the cangaceiros on how the movement can be seen as an spontaneous revolutionary movement of the poor men and women against the feudal opression of the coronéis. Thus, he continues, if we could introduce the cangaço bands to the ANL programmes, they could serve us very well on political brawls against the conservative landowners of these states."
 bra.15.t:0 "The Second Coluna Prestes returns to Rio"
 bra.15.d:0 "After a two-months long journey across Bahia and Ceará, the second 'Prestes Column' made a triumphal return to our capital today. Luís Carlos Prestes himself made a long speech in downtown Rio de Janeiro sharing the adventures of his companions with the passer-bys. He stressed that, while the life of the northeastern peasant is still much harsh, they have much expectation now that the ANL has assumed power. Prestes then proceeded to the Palácio do Catete, where he presented his finds and suggestions to the land reform comission."

Prestes then proceeded to the Palácio do Catete, where he presented his finds and suggestions to the land reform comission. After that, he reassumed his post as Chief Minister."
 bra.17.t:0 "Starting the land reform programme"
 bra.17.d:0 "After dozens of surveys during the past months, a comission made up of members of the BOC, CBT and PSR, led by Minervino de Oliveira, has produced a white paper detailing three main plans for agrarian reform in Brazil. 'Plan A', defended by the BOC, proposes the collectivization of all arable land and their reorganization into smallers plots, headed by the peasants themselves, who will then organize and combine into cooperatives to sell their produce. The CBT-supported 'Plan B' sees the confiscation of all land by the federal government and its reorganization into grand state farms employing the majority of the rural population. There's still one more possibility, the 'Plan C' defended by the PSR. This third, more moderate option, proposes the collectivization of all the bigger farms and lands, while leaving the medium-sized and smaller lands still as private property. Plan C also defends the confiscation of unused plots and their reorganization into cooperatives - a system similar to the Ejidos adopted by Mexico after their revolution. Any of these options will make the big landowners complain, of course, but we must stick to our plans if we want the betterment of Brazil!"
 bra.18.t:0 "The Coronéis Protest"
 bra.18.d:0 "A group of coronéis - the traditional landed oligarchs of the northeastern states - has met today in Fortaleza, Ceará, and delivered a letter to the state governor to be handed to the President. On this document, they express their concern over 'the takeover of Brazil by socialist bandits' and promise to fight for the integrity of their lands. They also spoke on the 'supposed' support of the local peasants to the land reform. In fact, they say, most of the poorer farmers actually feel protected under the patronage of the coronéis!"
 bra.19.t:0 "Southern Landowners Protest"
 bra.19.d:0 "Seems that the northeastern coronéis are not our only concern, now. A group of industrialists, landowners and representants of the middle class under the leadership of defeated presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas has met today in Campinas, São Paulo, and protested against our land reform programmes."
 bra.20.t:0 "The Unsellable Coffee"
 bra.20.d:0 "The landed oligarchs of São Paulo have presented us with an issue. With coffee prices falling day by day on the international markets, these farmers are filling their warehouses with more and more unsellable harvests. According to our economists, if we don't act now, the deepening agricultural crisis will end up affecting not only the grand farmers, but also the poorer peasants that have just been benefited through our programmes."
 bra.21.t:0 "Burn, coffee, burn!"
 bra.21.d:0 "All across the southern states, giant bonfires are burning thousands of sacks of coffee. According to our economists, this will reduce the offer of Brazilian coffee worldwide, which will in turn raise its price on the international markets. Even if we have spent some money on this, but this investiment will return to us in the form of taxes eventually."
 bra.22.t:0 "A coup to save Syndicalism?"
 bra.22.d:0 "News of the compromise between the elites and the government against the peasants of Brazil, who were expecting a broad land reform programme, has already reached the streets. Discontent is much apparent. Over the last few days, a sector of Tenentista officers of our army, under the leadership of Luís Carlos Prestes and Isidoro Dias Lopes, has been setting up a plan to overthrow Edgard Leuenroth and, with this, 'save the socialist project for Brazil from being aborted by an weak, uncommited and incompetent president'. News of this growing conspiracy have already reached some parts of our cabinet. Now, how should our government act? We can't simply dismiss Prestes from the army, as that would bring the whole armed forces against the government. We could, instead, remove him from his present post and relocate him to some remote station... That would be enough of a punishment for him and would save everyone from any major scandal. Or we could embrace his conspiracy and put him on the presidency."
