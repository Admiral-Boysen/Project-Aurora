rusfor.1.d:0 "Now that our regime is firmly established we can begin to consider our stance regarding the rest of the world. Russia should start being more active on the world stage but we are too weak to interfere in the German or Japanese spheres of influence. The Caucasus, bordering the dying Ottoman Empire, is an easy region to subjugate and has large oil deposits for us to exploit. Central Asia, with its unstable situation between Alash Orda and Turkestan, is an even more easier region to subjugate. We should focus on these areas before going anywhere else."
rusfor.1.a:0 "Let's show the world our might !"
rusfor.1000.t:0 "Report from Russia"
rusfor.1000.d:0 "Our secret service reports that Russia plans to once again secure the Caucasus region. Such a drastic step means a direct threat to the stability of Eastern Europe which was set by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. What shall we do?"

rusfor.1005.d:0 "The German Kaiser has made it clear that his Empire would fully support the independence of the Caucasian nations if any other nation tries to interfere. It would be most unwise to underestimate them despite the troubles they are facing on the homefront. How shall we react to this statement?"
rusfor.1005.a:0 "Who cares?"
rusfor.1005.b:0 "Let us focus on Central Asia instead !"
rusfor.1006.t:0 "Russia has ignored our demands"
rusfor.1006.d:0 "The Russian state, in its foolish pride, has refused our reasonable demands regarding the territorial integrity and independence of the Caucasian states. How shall we react to this insolence?"
rusfor.1006.a:0 "Cease all contacts between Mitteleuropa and Russia!"
rusfor.1006.b:0 "Insolent brats, we will show you German might!"
rusfor.1006.c:0 "Back down, we can not afford a conflict with Russia."
rusfor.1007.t:0 "Mitteleuropa ceases all contacts with us"
rusfor.1007.d:0 "In reaction to our refusal to alter the planned ´stabilization´ of the Caucasian region the German Empire has ordered the cessation of all trade and diplomatic contacts between our state and Mitteleuropa. Our industrial sector is already feeling the consequences of such drastic actions."
rusfor.1007.a:0 "We shall survive!"

rusfor.1008.a:0 "Great !"
rusfor.1009.t:0 "What do to with Don-Kuban Union?"
rusfor.1009.d:0 "The lands of the Don and Kuban cossack hosts, between the Black and Caspian seas, was historically a part of the Russian Empire until, during the chaos of the Bolshevik Revolution and ensuing Civil War and German Intervention, an independent Don-Kuban Union was established by charismatic White leader Petr Krasnov with support from Berlin. Now, however, Russia seems ready to reincorporate this petty state into the Motherland. How shall we proceed? Whatever course of action we take, we must be prepared for a conflict of interests with Germany, as the Reich will certainly not take lightly our ambitions, especially towards a state friendly to them."
rusfor.1009.a:0 "Start consulting with Germany"
rusfor.1009.b:0 "Start sending agitators"
rusfor.1009.c:0 "Start thinking about a plebiscite."
rusfor.1010.t:0 "Russia wants to seize Don-Kuban"
rusfor.1010.d:0 "The Russian ambassador has approached the minister of foreign affairs about dissolving the Don-Kuban Union. Since the '20s Germany has guaranteed our independence but the Russians look at them as a 'rebellious state'. If we withdraw support for the Cossacks and allow the annexation Russia would be much more eager to cooperate with us. Let's remember that Russia has many means of interfering in Don-Kuban so even if we refuse to talk the situation in the Caucasus can change."
rusfor.1010.a:0 "The Russians are right, it's a part of their country."
rusfor.1010.b:0 "Don-Kuban is our partner! Never."
rusfor.1011.t:0 "Russia wants to seize us!"
rusfor.1011.d:0 "Germany decided to leave us alone. Now we are defenceless against the mighty Russian armies!"

rusfor.1012.t:0 "Claims on Don-Kuban Union"
rusfor.1012.d:0 "Our skillful diplomacy was able to provoke the Don-Kuban Union into declaring war upon us. Now we can finally reclaim the Don-Kuban union without needing to worry about international reactions."

rusfor.1015.b:0 "The rebels are crushed!"
rusfor.1016.t:0 "Russian Coup succeeds in Don-Kuban Union"
rusfor.1016.d:0 "Russians and Caucasian tribes have defeated the Cossacks. the future of the Don-Kuban lies in our hands."
rusfor.1016.a:0 "The Don-Kuban Union comes back to the Motherland!"
rusfor.1016.b:0 "We will puppet them."
rusfor.1017.t:0 "Business leaders want plebiscite"
rusfor.1017.d:0 "Local business leaders, inspired by the Russians, want a plebiscite concerning the future of our nation. How should we respond?"
rusfor.1017.a:0 "Allow"
rusfor.1017.b:0 "Don't allow"
rusfor.1018.t:0 "Plebiscite in the Don-Kuban Union"
rusfor.1018.d:0 "The people are flocking to the polling stations. Perhaps democracy can work from time to time."

rusfor.1018.b:0 "Don-Kuban will remain independent."
rusfor.1019.t:0 "Problem with Don-Kuban"
rusfor.1019.d:0 "It seems that our peaceful policy towards the Don-Kuban has failed. Now we have to reconsider more aggressive paths."
rusfor.1019.a:0 "Perhaps we have to overthrow Cossack rule over Don-Kuban."
rusfor.1019.b:0 "It means war!"
rusfor.1019.c:0 "The Cossack state is more stable than we thought, we can't defeat them."
rusfor.1020.t:0 "The Baku Oil Fields"
rusfor.1020.d:0 "Russia needs oil, and lots of it, if it is going to keep up with the other major powers in industrial and military production.  While we have limited oil fields in the central Siberia, our former province of Azerbaijan has a gigantic petroleum industry, which it is finding increasingly difficult to maintain.  Should we seek to promote our interests in this region?"
rusfor.1020.a:0 "Take over the Baku Oil Concern and control their Government!"
rusfor.1020.b:0 "Guarantee the security of Azerbaijan and invest in the oil fields."
rusfor.1020.c:0 "Who built Baku's oil plants? Make plans for a hostile takeover!"
rusfor.1020.e:0 "We shall take back our stolen plants by force, right now!"
rusfor.1021.t:0 "Russian Investment"
rusfor.1021.d:0 "The Russian Government has purchased a massive stake in the Baku Oil Concern and are planning on administering, securing and building up large portions of our oil fields themselves. This would mean that we would lose control over much of our government but would at least present us with a powerful patron."
rusfor.1021.a:0 "Invite the Russians to protect and develop Azerbaijan."
rusfor.1021.b:0 "Decline the offer, attempt to limit Russian influence!"
rusfor.1022.t:0 "Azerbaijani resistance"
rusfor.1022.d:0 "The foolish Azerbaijani government rejected our attempts to exert our influence over their government. How shall we react to this insolence?"
rusfor.1022.a:0 "War will solve this!"
rusfor.1022.b:0 "Back down."
rusfor.1023.t:0 "The Azeris agree!"
rusfor.1023.d:0 "Azerbaijan has accepted our purchase of a majority stake in their state oil industry. This gives us a large enough foothold to either totally dominate the economy and government of the country or attempt to begin plans to reincorporate them into Russia."
rusfor.1023.a:0 "Establish control over the Azeri economy."
rusfor.1023.b:0 "Start to plan on how best to incorporate Azerbaijan into Russia!"
rusfor.1024.t:0 "Azerbaijani Autonomy"
rusfor.1024.d:0 "With Russian domination over Azerbaijan stable some members of our goverment think that the time has come for the integration of Azerbaijan into the growing Russian empire. It would be quite easy to pass a series of laws which would ensure that the region is more firmly integrated into Russia."
rusfor.1024.a:0 "It is time for Russia to directly rule over Azerbaijan!"
rusfor.1024.b:0 "Azerbaijan must remain autonomous."
rusfor.1025.t:0 "The Georgian Question"
rusfor.1025.d:0 "Now that the Don-Kuban Union no longer exists we must choose our stance towards the independent state of Georgia.
