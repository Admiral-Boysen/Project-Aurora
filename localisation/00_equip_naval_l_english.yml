 submarine_pre_desc:0 "The first submarines opened a new horizon for naval warfare. These new vessels can break through enemy waters without being detected and wreak havoc on the convoy routes."
 destroyer_pre:0 "Destroyer Pre-WW1"
 destroyer_pre_desc:0 "Before WW1 these destroyers were used to protect capital ships from torpedo boats. Some of them were equiped with torpedoes themselves."
 light_cruiser_pre:0 "Light Cruiser Pre-WW1"
 light_cruiser_pre_desc:0 "Protected Cruisers were used to protect trade routes and scout enemy waters. Some of them were equiped with torpedoes effectively making them to torpedo cruisers."
 heavy_cruiser_pre:0 "Heavy Cruiser Pre-WW1"
 heavy_cruiser_pre_desc:0 "The armored cruiser was a type of warship of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was designed like other types of cruisers to operate as a long-range, independent warship, capable of defeating any ship apart from a battleship and fast enough to outrun any battleship it encountered."
 battle_cruiser_pre:0 "Battle Cruiser Pre-WW1"
 battle_cruiser_pre_desc:0 "The first battlecruisers were designed in the United Kingdom in the first decade of the century, as a development of the armoured cruiser, at the same time as the dreadnought succeeded the pre-dreadnought battleship. The goal of the design was to outrun any ship with similar armament, and chase down any ship with lesser armament; they were intended to hunt down slower, older armoured cruisers and destroy them with heavy gunfire while avoiding combat with the more powerful but slower battleships. However, as more and more battlecruisers were built, they were increasingly used alongside the better-protected battleships."
 battleship_pre:0 "Battleship Pre-WW1"
 battleship_pre_desc:0 "Considered by some to be a relic of a bygone era of naval warfare, by others as the most impressive ships ever built, no one can deny that these remnants of the battleship arms race constitute some of the most heavily armed and armored vessels ever built."

#### JAP - JAPAN ####
 JAP_submarine_pre:1 "Kaichu Class"
 JAP_submarine_pre_desc:1 "The Kaichu class submarines were built after WWI and based on the earlier submarines. These medium-sized submarines were adequately armed, possesses good operational range and had good speed for their time, but by 1938 they were somewhat outdated. Altogether 42 Kaichu type submarines were built for the IJN and the series included 7 variants."
 JAP_submarine_1:1 "Kaidai III Class"
 JAP_submarine_1_desc:1 "The Kaidai type submarine (Kaidai-gata sensuikan) was a type of 1st class submarine operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) before and during World War II. The type name, was shortened to Kaigun-shiki Ōgata Sensuikan. The nine Kaidai IIIs were based on earlier designs, but featured a strengthened hull. The "IIIb" types were 40 cm longer and had a different bow design. All nine boats were constructed between 1927 and 1930."
 JAP_destroyer_pre:1 "Momi Class"
 JAP_destroyer_pre_desc:1 "The Momi class was a development of the Enoki second-class destroyers, relying on the same basic hull. They were quite small, comparable to Royal Navy corvettes. The design incorporated features discovered on German destroyers captured during World War I, including a lengthened forecastle with a break forming a well deck immediately forward of the bridge. This arrangement, apparently derived from contemporary torpedo boat practice, offered the advantage of a low, semi protected area for the forward torpedo tubes albeit at the cost of becoming awash in heavy seas. Initial problems with stability during high-speed turns were later corrected by widening the beam and bringing up the waterline."
 JAP_light_cruiser_pre:1 "Suma Class"
 JAP_light_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "While more lightly armed and armored than many of its contemporaries, their small size and relatively simple design facilitated their construction and their relatively high speed made them useful for many military operations. Both participated in combat during the Russo-Japanese War and World War I."
 JAP_heavy_cruiser_pre:1 "Izumo Class"
 JAP_heavy_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "The Izumo-class cruisers were a pair of armored cruisers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) in the late 1890s. As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships herself, the vessels were built in Britain. They were part of the 'Six-Six Fleet' expansion program that began after the defeat of China during the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95. The sister ships participated in three of the four main naval battles of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05—the Battle of Port Arthur, the Battle off Ulsan and the Battle of Tsushima—but played a much more minor role in World War I."
 JAP_battle_cruiser_pre:1 "Tsukuba Class"
 JAP_battle_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "The Tsukuba-class cruisers were a pair of large armored cruisers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) in the first decade of the 20th century. Construction began during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 and their design was influenced by the IJN's experiences during the war. The British development of the battlecruiser the year after Tsukuba was completed made her and her sister ship Ikoma obsolete, as they were slower and more weakly armed than the British, and later German, ships. Despite this, they were reclassified in 1912 as battlecruisers by the IJN."
 JAP_battleship_pre:1 "Fuso Class"
 JAP_battleship_pre_desc:1 "The Fuso class battleships were built during WWI and modernized in the 1930's when the 1st London Naval Treaty banned construction of new battleships for the signatories. They were well-armored and armed, with the 6 twin turrets on the centerline giving a heavy broadside, but also limiting the extra AA weaponry these ships could carry." 
 JAP_battleship_1:1 "Nagato Class"
 JAP_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Nagato-class battleships were a pair of dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during World War I, although they were not completed until after the end of the war. Nagato, the lead ship of the class, frequently served as a flagship. Both ships carried supplies for the survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923. They were modernized in 1933–36 with improvements to their armor and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style."
 JAP_carrier_pre:1 "Hosho Class"
 JAP_carrier_pre_desc:1 "Hōshō, literally 'phoenix in flight' was the world's first commissioned ship that was designed and built as an aircraft carrier, and the first aircraft carrier of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). Commissioned in 1922, the ship was used for testing carrier aircraft operations equipment, techniques, such as take-offs and landings, and carrier aircraft operational methods and tactics. The ship provided valuable lessons and experience for the IJN in early carrier air operations. Hōshō's superstructure and other obstructions to the flight deck were removed in 1924 on the advice of experienced aircrews."
 JAP_carrier_1_desc:1 "The aircraft carrier Kaga was one of Japan's first fleet carriers. She was originally a battleship, but finished as an aircraft carrier. This resulted in a large and heavily armored carrier with limited space for improvement. However, it was an important experience in aircraft carrier construction for the Imperial Japanese Navy."

The design incorporated features discovered on German destroyers used during World War I, including a lengthened forecastle with a break forming a well deck immediately forward of the bridge.
