### Name and Description
GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Legacy of the Weltkrieg"

### Germany 
GER_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1919 the German army finally overrunned the Entente defences in France, soon ending the war with Britain in 1921. Even though Admiral Tirpitz, the new German chancellor in 1924, brought prosperity and stability to the country, since the Grand Admiral’s death in 1930 things have been going downhill for Germany. A slowing of the world economy is decreasing industrial output as other nations recover their manufacturing power, and nationalism grows in Germany’s eastern clients which are starting to drift away from the Reich. In 1936, Imperial Germany stands at a crossroads, we can already see cracks in her mighty empire, and her ancestral enemies are getting stronger once more..."
### Austria
AUS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Weltkrieg revealed the weakness and the dependence to the Germans of Austria and the 20's ended her dream of power as Emperor Karl died in 1922, passing the throne to his 10 year old son Otto followed by a collapse of the industry due to competition from German manufactures and the need for German mediation to resolve the deadlock of the Ausgleich negotitions in 1927, which resulted in the establishment of autonomy statutes for Bohemia and Galicia. However, there is a new hope for the Osterreich - now that Otto has come of age and the terms of the Ausgleich are to be renegotiated next year. Could this be the time for Austria to reassert the power of the Habsburg dynasty ?"
### Commune of France
FRA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The 3rd Republic ended in the way it began: defeated by German arms, and facing Communist Revolution at home. In 1919 a General Strike was called by the CGT, paralysing the country and causing the downfall of the bourgeois government. For the past 15 years the new ‘Commune of France’ has united behind a common platform of Syndicalist-Socialist consensus, headed by the Comité de Salut Public. However, by 1936 the consensus that was resolved to rebuild the country and defend the revolution is seen as outdated by many critics, and there is a growing call for more radical policies. France is confident in its mission, but it is unclear which revolutionary strands shall become dominant in the years to come..."
### Union of Britain
ENG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The British people are currently secure on their island, content to build socialism in political and economic isolation, protected by the strong Republican Air Force and Navy, and with each county protected by its own popular militia who act both as a reserve military and the new police constabularies. Yet, with the world seemingly ready to erupt into chaos, many are starting to wonder if Britain has a duty to spread the revolution to her former colonial territories. After all, the Monarchists in Canada cannot be allowed to plot against the Union indefinitely..."
