### Name and Description
KR_SCENARIO_NAME:0 "Legacy of the Weltkrieg"
KR_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "1936 is a turning point for the history of the world. Tensions between the German Empire and the Commune of France are growing more and more. Russia and the USA are increasingly unstable and may soon divert heavily from their set path while the old empires of Austria and Turkey are dissolving and Syndicalism is spreading worldwide. Fifteen years have passed since the end of the Weltkrieg and the old rivalries of before seem to have reappeared, a single spark may be all it takes."  
### Germany 
GER_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1919 the German army finally overran the Entente defences in France, in 1921 Britain surrendered as well. But even though the Weltkrieg saw its rise as an uncontested world power things have been going downhill for Germany since 1930. A slowing of the world economy is decreasing industrial output as other nations recover their manufacturing power and nationalism grows in Germany’s eastern clients which are starting to drift away from the Reich. In 1936, Imperial Germany stands at a crossroads, we can already see cracks in her mighty empire and her ancestral enemies are regaining their former strength..."
### Austria
AUS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "While the Weltkrieg revealed Austria's weakness and dependence on the Germans, the 20's definitely ended her dream of power. First, Emperor Karl died in 1922, passing the throne to his 10 year old son Otto. Soon after the Austrian industrial economy collapsed due to competition from German manufacturers. Finally the need for German mediation to resolve the deadlock of the Ausgleich negotiations in 1927 -resulting in autonomy statutes for Bohemia and Galicia- showed the weakness of the Empire. However, Otto has come of age and the terms of the Ausgleich are to be renegotiated next year could this be the time for Austria to reassert its power?"
### Commune of France
FRA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The 3rd Republic ended in the way it began: defeated by German arms, and facing Revolution at home. In 1919 a General Strike was called by the CGT, causing the downfall of the bourgeois government. For 15 years the new ‘Commune of France’ has united behind a common platform of Syndico-Socialist consensus, headed by the Comité de Salut Public. However, by 1936 the need to rebuild the country and defend the revolution is seen as outdated by many critics and there is a growing call for more radical policies. France is confident in its mission but it is unclear which revolutionary strands shall become dominant in the years to come..."
### Union of Britain
ENG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After 1921's 'Peace with Honour' ending the Weltkrieg the faith and support of the people in the Home Islands had disappeared. In 1925, disaster struck: a minor labour dispute quickly escalated into a General Strike called by the TUC, followed by military desertions to the strikers. After six weeks of rioting on a massive scale the Royal Family and most of the country's elites were evacuated to Canada and instead, a new Congress of Trade Unions assumed political authority. The British people are currently content to build socialism in isolation, yet, many are starting to think that the Monarchists in Canada cannot be allowed to plot against the Union indefinitely..."
### Canada
CAN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the collapse of royal authority in Britain in 1925 resulted in the royal family and central government fleeing to the country, Canada has been set down a peculiar path. Her economic prosperity after the Weltkrieg has been somewhat safeguarded by industrialisation funded by Britain's old families and trade links with the US however there is some dissent growing among the Canadians about the political dominance of the British exiles and the fixation of Canada towards their aim of ‘liberating’ Britain. The diplomatic situation with the UoB remained tense over the next decade but neither side was prepared or able to escalate matters into open warfare. By 1936, however Canada's navy continues to grow rapidly in strength, and some are beginning to suggest that the time has come to retake the Home Islands. With the feasibility of this goal growing with each day, war seems inevitable."
### Russia
RUS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The united White forces fought well during the civil war, but the Red Army was still too strong, dominating the industrial heartland. But soon the German empire, fearing red success, decided to intervene on behalf of the Whites. Two years later both Moscow and St. Petersburg fell to the White forces and a new Russian Republic was established. For the past fifteen years the leading parties, the S-R and Kadets, have governed in an uneasy coalition under Kerensky, but Russia is becoming increasingly unstable. Other political forces are growing, considering that it is now time for a change, so that the country may reassert its power in the world..."
### United States
USA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Even if the USA almost left their isolation to intervene in the Weltkrieg the policy of reconciliation of the Kaiser has kept them out of the war but, unfortunately for the US, the Central Powers won it. Since then the USA has struggled economically as most of their trade opportunities in Europe were closed by German victory. While still being regarded as a 'nobody' in international politics the regime now faces mounting internal dissent as the Republican-Democratic domination is challenged by two groups - the Syndicalists and the America First Union. With a mounting crisis at home and a lack of prestige overseas things aren't looking good for the USA."
### History
OTHER_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are waiting for their turn to rise as a major player of this world. From major powers trying to restore their empires to the many nations formed and transformed by the Weltkrieg, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
