GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 ""  
### Germany 
GER_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1919 the German army finally overran the Entente defences in France, in 1921 Britain surrendered as well. But even though the Weltkrieg saw its rise as an uncontested world power things have been going downhill for Germany since 1930. A slowing of the world economy is decreasing industrial output as other nations recover their manufacturing power and nationalism grows in Germany’s eastern clients which are starting to drift away from the Reich. In 1936, Imperial Germany stands at a crossroads, we can already see cracks in her mighty empire, and her ancestral enemies are getting stronger once more..."
### Austria
AUS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "While the Weltkrieg revealed Austria's weakness and her dependence on the Germans, the 20's definitely ended her dream of power. First, Emperor Karl died in 1922, passing the throne to his 10 year old son Otto. Soon after the Austrian industrial economy collapsed due to competition from German manufacturers. Finally the need for German mediation to resolve the deadlock of the Ausgleich negotiations in 1927 -resulting in the establishment of autonomy statutes for Bohemia and Galicia- showed the weakness of the Austrian Empire. However, Otto has come of age and the terms of the Ausgleich are to be renegotiated next year could this be the time for Austria to reassert its power?"
### Commune of France
FRA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The 3rd Republic ended in the way it began: defeated by German arms, and facing Revolution at home. In 1919 a General Strike was called by the CGT, causing the downfall of the bourgeois government. For 15 years the new ‘Commune of France’ has united behind a common platform of Syndico-Socialist consensus, headed by the Comité de Salut Public. However, by 1936 the need to rebuild the country and defend the revolution is seen as outdated by many critics, and there is a growing call for more radical policies. France is confident in its mission but it is unclear which revolutionary strands shall become dominant in the years to come..."
### Union of Britain
ENG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The British people are currently secure on their island.  Content to build socialism in political and economic isolation protected by the strong Republican Air Force and Navy and with each county protected by its own popular militia who act both as a reserve military and the new police constabularies. Yet, with the world seemingly ready to erupt into chaos, many are starting to wonder if Britain has a duty to spread the revolution to her former colonial territories. After all, the Monarchists in Canada cannot be allowed to plot against the Union indefinitely..."
