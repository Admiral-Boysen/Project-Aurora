### Event text ###

russia.1.t:0 "A troubled history"
russia.1.d:0 "At the Congress of Omsk in April 1919, the White Generals agreed to form a united political front behind Alexander Kerensky and the remaining forces of the Provisional Government.  The united White forces, joined by the republic of Finland, made considerable gains, but the Red Army was still too strong and well placed, dominating the Russian industrial heartland and transportation networks. But soon the German empire, fearing the success of a dangerous ideology, decided to intervene on behalf of the Whites in exchange for the recognition of the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. By September 1921, both Moscow and St. Petersburg fell to the White forces and a new Russian Republic was established in the old Imperial capital of St. Petersburg. For the past fifteen years the leading parties, the Social Revolutionaries and Kadets, have governed in an uneasy coalition under Kerensky, maintaining their power through electoral manipulation and a lack of serious political opposition. \n\n More specifically, 1936 is yet another dark time for Russia. The recent decision of the German Empire to push forward payment of reparations agreed upon in the Brest-Litovsk peace treaty, forced Russia to enact drastically reduced budget for an armed forces and existing social system. Such financial austerity, even if needed, combined with stagnation of economy has brought ire of the nation and pushed country to the verge of general unrests. With government barely controlling the streets of Moscow and St. Petersburg, let alone the rest of the country things are looking bad for Russia. However other political forces are growing, and considering that it is now time for a change, so that the country may once again assert its power in the world..."
russia.1.a:0 "Well, good luck for that"
russia.2.t:0 "The Russian constitution of 1918"
russia.2.d:0 "Signed in 1918, roughly a year after the fall of Nikolai II, the Russian constitution defines the country's political institutions. The legislative branch consists of the State Duma, elected every five years, and the Senate, consisting of senior nobles, statemen, scholars, etc. The executive branch is divided into the office of President, elected every six years by the Senate, and the Council of Ministers."
russia.2.a:0 "The constitution guarantees freedom and stability !"
russia.3.t:0 "Payment of the Brest-Litovsk Reparations"
russia.3.d:0 "The German decision during the Berlin Conference in November 1935 to force us to repay the remaining part of the war indemnities imposed upon us by the Central Powers at Brest-Litovsk one year earlier than planned has put the government in a delicate position. The current budget for 1936 is already stretched to a bare minimum and as a result, the cabinet sees no other alternative than imposing harsh austerity measures, if we are to pay the accursed Teutonics. The cuts in government spending will be most harshly felt in the social services sector and in the many homes of invalided war veterans depending on the state’s support. Our citizens are already disgruntled and dissatisfied with the incumbent coalition of Kadets, Rightist Social Revolutionaries united under the even more unpopular presidency of Aleksandr Kerensky and it is feared that these austerity measures will bring still more extreme political groupings unto the political scene."
russia.3.a:0 "We must increase austerity measures"
russia.4.t:0 "Payment of the Brest-Litovsk Reparations"
russia.4.d:0 "With stagnation of our economy and worsening conditions of our citizens during year 1935, our government has decided that in order to restart our economy we need additional cash. Only available option how to amass sufficient capital to help our economy was to force Russian state to prematurely repay remaining reparations from the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. During Berlin conference in november 1935 president Alexander Kerensky together with prime minister Pavel Milyukov were forced to accept premature payment of Brest-Litovsk reparations. With drastical austerity measures Russian state was able to prematurely repay remaining parts of its reparations as they were agreed in the treaty of Brest-Litovsk."
russia.4.a:0 "Excellent !"
russia.5.t:0 "The Assassination of Kerensky"
russia.5.d:0 "The President of Russian Republic, Alexander Kerensky has been assassinated ! While president Kerensky was being slowly driven in a car through the streets Petrograd, an unknown gunman stepped from street and shot the president and his chauffeur with a Mauser C96 semiautomatic pistol. Despite immediate aid Kerensky died in the car, slumped backwards in the seat, with his eyes open."
russia.5.a:0 "Goodbye Kerensky...."
russia.6.t:0 "The Aftermath of Assassination of Kerensky"
russia.6.d:0 "The assassination of our long term president, Alexander Kerensky, has thrown the country into chaos. With the president gone the governing coalition of Kadets and Right Social Revolutionaries has collapsed and four forces look ready to seize control of the broken nation."
russia.6.a:0 "The Left SR-Mensheviks secure a majority in the Duma."
russia.6.b:0 "Marshall Denikin declares martial law and dissolves the Duma."

russia.7.t:0 "Appointing a Prime Minister"
russia.7.d:0 "The remnants of Russia's nobility emerged from the turmoil of the civil war with much of their wealth intact. Still controlling large portions of the economy, the aristocrats dominated the Senate, the theoretically powerless Upper House. They have now taken advantage of the body's nominal authority to name the President and have selected Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich Romanov for the position. It is unclear who is the true instigator."
russia.7.a:0 "The reactionary landowners, led by Vladimir Purishkevich."
russia.7.b:0 "The Clericals under Patriarch Kiril."
russia.7.c:0 "The Kadets and liberals of Pavel Milyukov."
russia.7.e:0 "Felix Yusupov, the childhood friend of the Grand Duke!"
russia.8.t:0 "Appointing a Prime Minister"
russia.8.d:0 "The SR-Menshevik coalition out-maneuvered all of its rivals in the January crisis and have gained an unshakeable Duma majority following the submission of the Kadets. Chernov, chief ideologue of the SRs, has been successful in pulling the strings but it is now the time to appoint a Prime Minister."
russia.8.a:0 "Stay with the Mensheviks, Iraklij Tsereteliy."
russia.8.b:0 "Compromise, the Liberal Pavel Milyukov."
russia.8.c:0 "These are extreme times and we need a shot of Bolshevism, Nikolai Bukharin!"
russia.9.t:0 "Appointing a Prime Minister"
russia.9.d:0 "The Duma has been dissolved and martial law declared. Marshal Anton Denikin is now nominally of control of the country. A Prime Minister should be appointed for the new regime to broaden its basis of support."
russia.9.a:0 "Keep Kerensky's Prime Minister, Pavel Milyukov."
russia.9.b:0 "The leader of the Conservatives, Patriarch Kiril."
russia.9.c:0 "The chief of the reactionary landowners, Vladimir Purishkevich."
russia.9.e:0 "Russia needs but one ruler!"
russia.10.t:0 "A Second in Command?"
russia.10.d:0 "Wrangel's secret cabals of extremist officers control the streets, all senior Duma deputies are under arrest awaiting liquidation and communication lines are closely monitored. Baron Wrangel is in control and poised to build a new state but he needs a right hand man to carry out his ambitions."
russia.10.a:0 "The most promising of my lackeys, General Pavel Shatilov."
russia.10.b:0 "The leader of the Conservatives, Patriarch Kiril."
russia.10.c:0 "The flamboyant aristocrat, Felix Yusupov, will bring glamour to the Dictatorship!"
russia.10.e:0 "Pfah! I am the new Autocrat!"
