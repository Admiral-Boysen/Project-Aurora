russia.1.d:0 "At the Congress of Omsk in April 1919, the White Generals agreed to form a united political front behind Alexander Kerensky and the remaining forces of the Provisional Government.  The united White forces, joined by the republic of Finland, made considerable gains, but the Red Army was still too strong and well placed, dominating the Russian industrial heartland and transportation networks.

With government barely controlling the streets of Moscow and St. Petersburg, let alone the rest of the country things are looking bad for Russia. However other political forces are growing, and considering that it is now time for a change, so that the country may once again assert its power in the world..."
