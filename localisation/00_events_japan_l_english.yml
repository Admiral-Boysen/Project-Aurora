 japan.1.d:0 "All political parties have been voluntarily disbanded in the interest of the Emperor of Japan, seated on the throne and representing a divine succession that has been unbroken for ages. Our Imperial subjects must do their duties faithfully and diligently. Our Empire needs to mobilize against all enemies who don't accept our generous offers of friendship and fail to comprehend our Empire's far-sighted goal of world peace."
