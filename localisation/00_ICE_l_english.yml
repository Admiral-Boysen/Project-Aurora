 ice.1.t:0 "Fuel Shortage"
 ice.1.d:0 "Due to the recent economic downturn the government cannot afford much needed fuel for our economy, mainly the fishing fleet."
 ice.1.a:0 "Blast! No money!"
 ice.2.t:0 "Deal with Iceland"
 ice.2.d:0 "Due to the financial pressure that Iceland is under and the fact that they have very little fuel, it seems that this would be the best time to offer them a deal for fuel. We could use this as our first stepping stone to a longer deal that will benefit us."
 ice.2.a:0 "Approach them with a deal!"
 ice.2.b:0 "Not really the time."
 ice.3.t:0 "Canadian Fuel for Rights"
 ice.3.d:0 "The Canadians have approached us with a deal to bring much needed fuel into Iceland. We will need to give up some of our fishing rights off the coast of Greenland but we can avert a crisis."
 ice.3.a:0 "Accept the deal!"
 ice.3.b:0 "The price is too high."
 ice.4.t:0 "Iceland Accepts"
 ice.4.d:0 "Iceland has accepted the deal. We are in business and we may extend our fishing operations around coast of Greenland as well begin with plan to extend our influence over Iceland in order to make it base for future invasion of British isles."
 ice.4.a:0 "Great News!"
 ice.5.t:0 "Iceland Refuses"
 ice.5.d:0 "Damn those Icelanders! They have refused our offer to supply them with fuel in return for them giving up fishing rights around the coast of Greenland. We must find other way to allow us to extend our influence over their island."
 ice.5.a:0 "Too bad."
 ice.6.t:0 "Royalist Meddle in Iceland"
 ice.6.d:0 "The Royalists are using the Icelanders' fuel crisis to meddle in Iceland's affairs. This is obviously the first move in a plot to gain foothold on Iceland and use it as base for another foolish attempt to retake British isles. Republican navy was ordered on full alert in response to this threat..."
 ice.6.a:0 "We need to keep our eyes on this."
 ice.7.t:0 "The Fishermen Protest"
 ice.7.d:0 "Fishermen have begun protesting against our decision to give up our fishing rights off the coast of Greenland, we were forced to accept in treaty we have signed with Canada. If they would only see reason..."
 ice.7.a:0 "Blasted fishermen!"
 ice.8.t:0 "Opposition Demands the End to the Deal"
 ice.8.d:0 "The opposition part has demanded that we cancel the deal with Canada to address the concerns of the fishermen. If we cancel the deal we will be forced to look elsewhere for fuel but if we don't we will have to face a crisis at home."
 ice.8.a:0 "We need that fuel!"
 ice.8.b:0 "Cancel the deal."
 ice.9.t:0 "Iceland cancels Deal"
 ice.9.d:0 "Bowing to pressure at home, the Icelandic government has cancelled its controversial trade deal they had with Canada. This should be most unfortunate for the ambitions the Canadians have with Iceland..."
 ice.9.a:0 "Too bad."
 ice.9.b:0 "Interesting."
 ice.10.t:0 "The Reykjavik Riots"
 ice.10.d:0 "The refusal of the Icelandic government to cancel its controversial trade deal with Canada has led to large riots in Reykjavik called by opposition parties, socialists and various labour unions. They are demanding an immediate end to the trade deal regarding fishing right along the coast of Greenland as well as an end to unwelcomed Canadian meddling in Icelandic national affairs."
 ice.10.a:0 "Damn those rioters!"
 ice.10.b:0 "Interesting."
 ice.11.t:0 "Modifying the Deal"
 ice.11.d:0 "With all the riots in Reykjavik and our inablity to restore order we are hoping to modify the deal with Canada so we can quell some of the dissent in the city. We have offered Canada the ability to station troops in Iceland to hopefully restore order."
 ice.11.a:0 "Send the request."
 ice.11.b:0 "We shall solve this on our own!"
 ice.12.t:0 "Send the Troops to Iceland"
 ice.12.d:0 "Iceland wishes to modify the treaty with us to gain the fishing rights back. In return they are offering us the ability to station our land, naval and air forces there. Just what we wanted..."
 ice.12.a:0 "Accept their proposition."
 ice.12.b:0 "Refuse such a proposal!"
 ice.13.t:0 "Canadian Troops in Ireland"
 ice.13.d:0 "The Canadian Royalists have used their deal with the government of Iceland to move their forces onto Iceland. There is no doubt that they will use the Island as a base for further incursions against the Union of Britain."
 ice.13.a:0 "This is unacceptable!"
 ice.13.b:0 "Excellent."
 ice.13.c:0 "Interesting."
 ice.14.t:0 "Blockading Iceland"
 ice.14.d:0 "The Royalist incursion in Iceland is unacceptable. If we do not act now, while their control over island is tenuous and syndicalist movement in Iceland is still strong they solidify their control over island, making it permanent base for their further incursions against us. A blockade is probably the best approach to remove the Royalists and their influence from Iceland."
 ice.14.a:0 "Go ahead with the blockade!"
 ice.14.b:0 "We are not ready for this."
 ice.15.t:0 "Britain blockades Iceland"
 ice.15.d:0 "In protest to the changes to the Canadian trade treaty with Iceland, which allowed Canada to station troops on Iceland, the Syndicalist Union of Britain has set up a blockade around Iceland! Foreign trade ships are being turned back by the Syndicalist Navy."
 ice.15.aa:0 "This is horrible!"
 ice.15.ab:0 "We must respond!"
 ice.15.ac:0 "Finally!"
 ice.15.ad:0 "Interesting."
