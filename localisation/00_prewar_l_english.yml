prewar.1.t:0 "The 5 year anniversary of the 1932 Geneva Strike"
prewar.1.d:0 "5 years ago today the workers of Geneva began a major industrial action, demanding social and economic reforms, which threatened to spread to the rest of French-speaking western Switzerland (known as the Romandy). Fearful of potential revolutionary influence by the Commune of France, the central government in Bern reacted swiftly by sending in the Federal Army to break the strike. In the ensuing violence 13 were killed and over 100 injured in Geneva. This has left a bitter divide between the Romandy and Bern which over the subsequent years has failed to heal. Encouraged by recent developments in France the radical left has begun to agitate once more and is planning on standing Socialist candidates in the upcoming local elections. However the social democrats, traditionally very strong in the Romandy have devised a reform package in conjunction with the trade unions, the ""Peace of Work"" agreement, which involves a number of policies regarding wage increases, shift times and so on. One of the key points is to put an end to the massive lockouts in watch manufactures which have taken place recently. The social democratic candidates are relying on this program to be re-elected and hopefully defuse the stand-off between the radical left and the conservative dominated Federal government in Bern."
prewar.1.a:0 "An unfortunate development"
prewar.2.a:0 "An interesting development"
prewar.3.t:0 "Socialist election victory in the Romandy"
prewar.3.d:0 "Backed by the conservative Federal government and the majority of the German-speaking cantons, the Swiss employer's organisations have refused to sign the so-called ""Peace of Work"" agreement proposed by the trade unions to put an end to the massive lockouts happing in the watch manufacturies. While the moderate social-democrats have been disgraced, French-speaking workers, whose resentment towards the current government and the Federal Army (largely dominated by German-speaking officers) has been growing since the violent repression of a workers' strike in Geneva in 1932, have returned a landslide victory to Socialist and pro-Syndicalist candidates in all cantonal elections, bringing in leftist councils in Geneva, Lausanne and Neufchâtel which are now calling for ambitious reforms."
prewar.3.a:0 "Damn those socialists!"
prewar.4.t:0 "Pro-syndicalist victory in the Romandy"
prewar.4.d:0 "Thanks to the ill-advised measures taken by Swiss authorities to put an end to their unions' demands for better wages and legal protection of labour rights, our efforts to spread Syndicalism among Romandy workers in Switzerland have borne fruit and leftist local governments have been elected in French-speaking cantons. This is a great opportunity for the Commune to forge stronger ties with them. However the pro-German and pro-Austrian conservatives will probably try to topple these worker's elected representatives by all means available including brute force..."
prewar.4.a:0 "Try to gain influence over the newly elected socialists!"
prewar.4.b:0 "It is too risky....."
prewar.5.t:0 "Syndicalist subversion at work in Romandy !"
prewar.5.d:0 "While the newly elected Socialist governments in Romandy have stepped into office, Federal intelligence services are reporting that French agents have crossed the border to advise the Romand leftists whilst a partial mobilisation of French border units near Geneva is also said to be under way. The situation is getting too dangerous and a move to force the Socialist governments to step down and have new elections in the Romandy seems inevitable, even if it means temporary military occupation of the Romandy by the Federal army. But the risk of triggering a French armed response is high, though, and we cannot be sure of Mitteleuropa's support..."
prewar.5.a:0 "Disband local governments in french speaking cantons !"
prewar.5.b:0 "We must respect constitution....."
prewar.6.t:0 "Geneva and the Swiss French"
prewar.6.d:0 "The bourgeois Swiss government has shown its true face and has toppled the democratically elected Socialist councils in Geneva, Lausanne and other French-speaking cantons! Our agents have reported numerous atrocities against armed workers and civilians as the Swiss Federal Army has implemented martial law. Despite their best efforts, some French-speaking syndicalist sympathisers have evaded the Federal Army and found a safe haven in our country. They have just set up a secessionist Swiss-French government-in-exile and call for union with the Commune. Since none of the reactionary Powers seem to be willing to come to Switzerland's rescue, this is a one-time opportunity to send an ultimatum to Bern and add the Romandy to our territory."
prewar.6.a:0 "Demand the Romandy Province from the Swiss!"
prewar.7.b:0 "We would like to stay on decent terms with the Swiss."
