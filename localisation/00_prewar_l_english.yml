prewar.1.t:0 "The 5 year anniversary of the 1932 Geneva Strike"
prewar.1.d:0 "5 years ago today the workers of Geneva began a major industrial action, demanding social and economic reforms, which threatened to spread to the rest of French-speaking western Switzerland (known as the Romandy). Fearful of potential revolutionary influence by the Commune of France, the central government in Bern reacted swiftly by sending in the Federal Army to break the strike. In the ensuing violence 13 were killed and over 100 injured in Geneva. This has left a bitter divide between the Romandy and Bern which over the subsequent years has failed to heal. Encouraged by recent developments in France the radical left has begun to agitate once more and is planning on standing Socialist candidates in the upcoming local elections. However the social democrats, traditionally very strong in the Romandy have devised a reform package in conjunction with the trade unions, the ""Peace of Work"" agreement, which involves a number of policies regarding wage increases, shift times and so on. One of the key points is to put an end to the massive lockouts in watch manufactures which have taken place recently. The social democratic candidates are relying on this program to be re-elected and hopefully defuse the stand-off between the radical left and the conservative dominated Federal government in Bern."
prewar.1.a:0 "An unfortunate development"
prewar.2.a:0 "An interesting development"
prewar.3.t:0 "Socialist election victory in the Romandy"
prewar.3.d:0 "Backed by the conservative Federal government and the majority of the German-speaking cantons, the Swiss employer's organisations have refused to sign the so-called ""Peace of Work"" agreement proposed by the trade unions to put an end to the massive lockouts happing in the watch manufacturies. While the moderate social-democrats have been disgraced, French-speaking workers, whose resentment towards the current government and the Federal Army (largely dominated by German-speaking officers) has been growing since the violent repression of a workers' strike in Geneva in 1932, have returned a landslide victory to Socialist and pro-Syndicalist candidates in all cantonal elections, bringing in leftist councils in Geneva, Lausanne and Neufchâtel which are now calling for ambitious reforms."
prewar.3.a:0 "Damn those socialists!"
prewar.4.t:0 "Pro-syndicalist victory in the Romandy"
prewar.4.d:0 "Thanks to the ill-advised measures taken by Swiss authorities to put an end to their unions' demands for better wages and legal protection of labour rights, our efforts to spread Syndicalism among Romandy workers in Switzerland have borne fruit and leftist local governments have been elected in French-speaking cantons. This is a great opportunity for the Commune to forge stronger ties with them. However the pro-German and pro-Austrian conservatives will probably try to topple these worker's elected representatives by all means available including brute force..."
prewar.4.a:0 "Try to gain influence over the newly elected socialists!"
prewar.4.b:0 "It is too risky....."
prewar.5.t:0 "Syndicalist subversion at work in Romandy !"
prewar.5.d:0 "While the newly elected Socialist governments in Romandy have stepped into office, Federal intelligence services are reporting that French agents have crossed the border to advise the Romand leftists whilst a partial mobilisation of French border units near Geneva is also said to be under way. The situation is getting too dangerous and a move to force the Socialist governments to step down and have new elections in the Romandy seems inevitable, even if it means temporary military occupation of the Romandy by the Federal army. But the risk of triggering a French armed response is high, though, and we cannot be sure of Mitteleuropa's support..."
prewar.5.a:0 "Disband local governments in french speaking cantons !"
prewar.5.b:0 "We must respect constitution....."
prewar.6.t:0 "Unrest in Romandy !"
prewar.6.d:0 "The Federal Council, backed up by local French-speaking conservatives, has ordered ""sure"" (i.e. German-speaking) Federal Army units to enter Romand cantons to introduce martial law. Socialist leaders, as well as many workers and Syndicalist sympathisers, have been arrested and provisional local governments are being set up under Federal supervision. In spite of our efforts, some Socialist councilors have managed to escape to France and they are now calling for secession and armed resistance against Federal rule. Despite the repression, the Romandy is now being plagued by massive strikes and armed incidents as demoblised French speaking Army units form militias. Meanwhile, an unusual concentration of French infantry and tanks is currently exercising in the Jura mountains, and violation of Swiss airspace by French aircraft is becoming more and more frequent."
prewar.6.a:0 "Damn those traitors!"
prewar.7.t:0 "Geneva and the Swiss French"
prewar.7.d:0 "The bourgeois Swiss government has shown its true face and has toppled the democratically elected Socialist councils in Geneva, Lausanne and other French-speaking cantons! Our agents have reported numerous atrocities against armed workers and civilians as the Swiss Federal Army has implemented martial law. Despite their best efforts, some French-speaking syndicalist sympathisers have evaded the Federal Army and found a safe haven in our country. They have just set up a secessionist Swiss-French government-in-exile and call for union with the Commune. Since none of the reactionary Powers seem to be willing to come to Switzerland's rescue, this is a one-time opportunity to send an ultimatum to Bern and add the Romandy to our territory."
prewar.7.a:0 "Demand the Romandy Province from the Swiss!"
prewar.7.b:0 "We would like to stay on decent terms with the Swiss."
prewar.8.t:0 "Dissent in the Romandy Province and the French Ultimatum"
prewar.8.d:0 "The French have demanded the French-speaking province of Romandy. They have fabricated claims of White Terror perpetuated by the Swiss Federation and Syndicalist leaders across Switzerland are getting involved. We can not guarantee that we will have German support if we stand up to these Syndicalist bastards."
prewar.8.a:0 "Accept the French Claims."
prewar.8.b:0 "We wont be bullied by these Syndicalist bastards!"
prewar.8.c:0 "Turn to the German Empire for protection!"
prewar.9.t:0 "The Commune of France threatens Switzerland!"
prewar.9.d:0 "The Commune of France, in its mad quest for power, is demanding the province of Romandy from Switzerland. This latest diplomatic crisis threatens to disrupt the balance of power in favour of the Internationale. Shall we threaten the French with war or will Switzerland stand alone?"
prewar.9.a:0 "Warn them to turn back or face German arms!"
prewar.9.b:0 "We can not involve ourselves in this!"
prewar.10.t:0 "The German Empire has abandoned us!"
prewar.10.d:0 "Our attempt to protect our independence and territorial integrity against the outrageous French claims with German mediation ended in failure. Our confederation stands alone against the Syndicalist menace."
prewar.11.t:0 "The Germans send an ultimatum!"
prewar.11.d:0 "The German Empire has sent an ultimatum to Paris. We are to cease our diplomatic and undercover activities aimed against the territorial integrity of Switzerland or face the might of the German army."
prewar.11.a:0 "We can not risk war with Germany. For now."
prewar.11.b:0 "Ignore these feeble German threats!"
prewar.12.t:0 "The Commune of France Backs Down!"
prewar.12.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by Paris they quickly ceased all diplomatic and undercover activities aimed against the territorial integrity of Switzerland. We have achieved a diplomatic victory today, we have shown the world we will stand up to Socialist and Syndicalist aggression and we will protect any nation under threat from these revolutionaries!"
prewar.12.a:0 "Diplomacy has achieved peace once again!"
prewar.13.t:0 "The French Ignore our Ultimatum"
prewar.13.d:0 "The French have ignored our ultimatum and are continuing their destabilization efforts against Switzerland. We can either declare war, bringing Switzerland into our alliance, or we can stand down and let Switzerland stand alone."
prewar.13.a:0 "They have made their choice. War it is!"
prewar.13.b:0 "Back Down! We'are not ready for war !"
prewar.14.t:0 "Commune of France abandons its claims!"
prewar.14.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by Paris they quickly ceased all their diplomatic and undercover activities against us. Swiss independence and territorial integrity will be kept, as well as our national pride."
prewar.14.a:0 "We couldn't have done it without Germany!"
prewar.15.t:0 "The Swiss Federation Accepts"
prewar.15.d:0 "We have demanded the Romandy province to defend our people and the Swiss have accepted."
prewar.15.a:0 "Good!"
prewar.16.t:0 "The Swiss cave in"
prewar.16.d:0 "With the humiliation of Switzerland we must now be more prepared than ever to war with France and her allies!"
prewar.16.a:0 "We will be ready !"
prewar.17.t:0 "The Swiss Federation Refuses"
prewar.17.d:0 "We have demanded the Romandy province to defend our people, and the Swiss have refused."
prewar.17.a:0 "We must wait."
prewar.17.b:0 "What they won't give we'll take, to war!"
prewar.18.t:0 "The Romandy War"
prewar.18.d:0 "The Commune of France and the Swiss Federation have declined all other options and the war has begun. The Swiss have asked for our help, this would give us an oppurtunity to reunite the Italian Peninsula!"
prewar.18.a:0 "France must be stopped here and now!"
prewar.18.b:0 "The Italian Federation declares its neutrality."
prewar.19.t:0 "The Romandy War"
prewar.19.d:0 "France has gone to war with the neutral Swiss Federation over the Romandy Province, a province with a majority of Swiss French. France has used fabricated stories of 'White Terror' in Geneva as a pretext for their invasion. Now we must decide if Switzerland is a lost cause or if we are going to intervene on behalf of the Federation."
prewar.19.a:0 "We must preserve Switzerland's autonomy!"
prewar.19.b:0 "We're not yet ready."
prewar.21.t:0 "French-speaking Socialists call for union with Commune of France"
prewar.21.d:0 "The uneasy truce observed between the Federal government and the Socialist-controlled local councils in French-speaking cantons has come to an end. After several clashes between German-speaking soldiers in training and Geneva policemen, the Romand socialist leaders, pressed by the worker's militias, have proclaimed secession from Switzerland and the constitution of a so-called ""Romand Socialist Federation"". According to intelligence reports, the French and the secessionists have engaged in talks about an union between the Romand cantons and the Commune of France."
prewar.21.a:0 "Damn those traitors!"
prewar.22.t:0 "Socialists are trying to take control over Romandy !"
prewar.22.d:0 "Despite the repression conducted by Federal Army troops and loyal Romands, Socialist militias, reportedly using French-made heavy weapons and equipment, are on the offensive in almost all of the Romandy. Main lines of communication with the rest of Switzerland may fall under secessionist control, as well as most of the region's infrastructure. Geneva's State Council is besieged by pro-French militias and exiled Socialists are said to have returned from France to form a new and unified Socialist government. It also seems that the Federal Army has no control over the Swiss-French border anymore."
prewar.22.a:0 "Romandy has been taken by socialists !"
prewar.22.b:0 "Their feeble attempts were crushed by army !"
prewar.23.t:0 "Annexation of Romandy !"
prewar.23.d:0 "The brave workers and peasants of the French-speaking Swiss cantons have won their fight against the reactionary forces of the Bern government! At the unanimous request of the newly establish Communes of Geneva and Romandy, The Comité de Salut Public has proclaimed their union with the Commune of France. While the local militias are being integrated in the Communal Army, French motorised units, supported by air forces, are heading towards the new border to prevent any retaliatory offensive from a revanchist Swiss government."
prewar.23.a:0 "Glory to the workers of the Romandy!"
prewar.24.t:0 "Commune of France have occupied the Romandy!"
prewar.24.d:0 "The treacherous Socialist rebels in the Romandy, who had been on the verge of being wiped out by our brave soldiers, have called the Commune of France for protection! Last night French troops supported by tanks and bombers entered Swiss territory up to Fribourg, while elite French mountain troops have stormed our defensive positions in the Alps and in the Jura mountains. French state broadcasters have announced that the Romandy has been annexed to the Commune of France, all the while routed soldiers and refugees are arriving in Bern in the thousands. Our ambassador in Paris has been warned that any attempt to resist the Armée de la Commune would lead to massive bombings of Zurich, Basel and Bern and the total annihilation of Swiss military capacities."
prewar.24.a:0 "There is nothing we can do....."
prewar.24.b:0 "We must reclaims our stolen territories with war!"
prewar.25.t:0 "White terror in Switzerland"
prewar.25.d:0 "The Swiss Federal Army and its repugnant reactionary volunteer auxiliaries have defeated the heroic defenders of Socialist revolution in the Romandy. As thousands stream across the border to seek asylum in France, French-speaking militiamen are executed after mock trials, while right-wing activists and bourgeois hunt down Socialists, Anarchists an Syndicalists, loot their homes and take gruesome revenge on their families. Such atrocities, reported by our state broadcasters, are causing an uproar in France and every true Syndicalist is now ready to free the Romandy from the clutches of Switzerland's bloodthirsty rulers. As our aircraft are ready to take off and strike against Swiss territory and our troops are concentrating near the border, the Comité de Salut Public has informed Bern that should the Romandy not be evacuated by the Swiss Federal Army and its control transferred to Communal authorities, war would be inevitable."
prewar.25.a:0 "Ready the troops!"
prewar.26.t:0 "The Assassination of Ambassador Albert Dufour-Feronce"
prewar.26.d:0 "Our Ambassador to Austria, Albert Dufour-Feronce, was found dead in his home in Munich today. The evidence has clearly shown that he was murdered by a French Anarcho-Syndicalist named Gustave Bouvet. Bouvet was found boarding the Fast Train from Berlin to Bucharest where he planned on crossing the Black Sea into Georgia. There is no evidence this was planned by the French but it is an outrage just the same!"
prewar.26.a:0 "The Execution of the assassin is enough to satisfy the people."
prewar.26.b:0 "Its time to stand up to these anarchists! This means war!"
prewar.28.t:0 "The Union of Britain at war" 
prewar.28.d:0 "The Union of Britain is currently engaged in a deadly war with its enemies. Without our help it is not sure that they will be able to prevail in this contest. If the Union of Britain falls we will lose a major potential ally on this continent and it is being questioned if we could even keep up our industrial capacity without the resources the Union of Britain trades."
prewar.28.a:0 "We must help the Union of Britain!"
prewar.28.b:0 "It is not our war."
prewar.29.t:0 "Alliance with the Commune of France?"
prewar.29.d:0 "We are currently engaged in a deadly contest with our mortal enemies. Without foreign help our victory over our adversaries is not certain. Fortunately the Commune of France is presenting us with an option to formally join the Internationale, thus gaining the help of its members. Should we accept?"
prewar.29.a:0 "Yes, socialist countries should stick together!"
prewar.29.b:0 " No, we do not need them!"
prewar.30.t:0 "Union of Britain joins the internationale!"
prewar.30.d:0 "The Union of Britain accepted our offer and expressed its intention to formally join the internationale. For the world revolution!"
prewar.30.a:0 "Welcome!"
