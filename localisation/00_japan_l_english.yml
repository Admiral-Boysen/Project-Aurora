 kr.japan.0.t:0 "Japan Historical Info"
 kr.japan.0.d:0 "While the 'Peace with Honor' guaranteed Japan's rule of her overseas territories, most importantly Korea, the situation in Japan was already critical well before the end of Weltkrieg. Japan's once booming economy had turned to ashes immediately after the collapse of France and the gap between social classes continued to widen. Starting with the Rice Riot of 1918, the later period of the Taisho Era (1912-1926) witnessed severe economic crises and social conflict. Also one of the greatest natural disasters in human history happened, the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, which was then followed by an anarchist rebellion influenced by France's syndicalist revolution. After a failed attempt on Regent Hirohito's life by a lone anarchist, martial law was declared for the first time in Japanese history. General Tanaka Giichi (1864-1936) formed a cabinet with support from the Genro and Seiyuhonto (splinter groups of the Seiyukai), and then introduced the Peace Preservation Law which symbolized the Draconian rule of Tanaka. However, with collapse of the British Empire and with the economic depression in America, Japan's export-led economy continued free fall with no end in sight. 1926 saw a series of massive bank closures at home and German military intervention in China. As Tanaka was incapable to protect Japan's interest in China or stabilise financial system, the weakness of his rule was exposed. By April of that year, the two main opposition parties, Seiyukai and Kenseikai, formed a coalition and and started so-called 'the 2nd Movement to Protect the Constitution'. With popular support for the opposition and Prince Regent's indirect intervention, Tanaka was forced to resign. The coalition cabinet was formed, marking the beginning of democratic governance, universal suffrage and party-based cabinet. The coalition however, collapsed over the issue of intervention in Manchuria. Prime minister Inukai Tsuyoshi, and his Seiyukai cabinet, was determined to support Zhang Zuelin, the Warlord of Manchuria in an attempt to alleviate or resolve a number of economic difficulties, and prevent a complete German domination of China. On June 4 Japanese troops crossed the Manchurian border and quickly occupied all of Manchuria. Further advances were halted however due to diplomatic pressure emanating from Berlin. Nevertheless the success of the campaign helped to solidify the strong position of the military, most of whom felt the way forwards was to seek further conquests elsewhere. The chaotic year of 1926 ended with the death of Emperor Taisho and his son Hirohito assumed the throne. The next nine years saw mild economic recovery and peaceful political developments. Japan in 1936 is poised to extend her empire, with Germany's dominance of the world appearing to be in decline the Japanese look greedily at both the remaining Qing Chinese territories and the German pacific possessions."
 kr.japan.0.a:0 "Start"
 kr.japan.1.t:0 "Imperial Rule Assistance Society"
 kr.japan.1.d:0 "All political parties have been voluntarily disbanded in the interest of the Emperor of Japan, seated on the throne and representing a divine succession that has been unbroken for ages. Our Imperial subjects must do their duties faithfully and diligently. Our Empire needs to mobilize against all enemies who don't accept our generous offers of friendship and fail to comprehend our Empire's far-sighted goal of world peace."
 kr.japan.1.a:0 "Glory to the Rising Sun! Banzai! Banzai!"
 kr.japan.2.t:0 "Civil disobedience in Niigata"
 kr.japan.2.d:0 "The landlord-tenant relationship in Niigata has always been more 'feudalistic' than any other prefecture, and as the agricultural crisis of the 1930's progressed the prefecture produced some of the worst cases of tenancy dispute. The issue appears to have reached its boiling point. In a Niigata prefecture village named Obaden, a tenancy dispute got out of control and the villagers rioted, attacking officials and landlords. Tenants in the villages of Kisaki and Wata have followed suit, and we have a full-blown uprising on our hands."
 kr.japan.2.a:0 "Negotiate with the dissenters"
 kr.japan.2.b:0 "Crush this riot"
 kr.japan.3.t:0 "Spread of the Niigata Riot"
 kr.japan.3.d:0 "We have made little progress negotiating with the Niigata uprising, and to make matters worse it has begun to spread. In the city of Nagaoka, members of a local trade union occupied a section of one of the main factories of the city, demanding higher wages and better working conditions for the labourers. Local police quickly intervened, but killed two of the strikers while taking control of the factory. Sympathetic workers have joined the movement and occupied a good part of the city's industrial districts, and are also calling for a general strike unless their demands are met. They also demand the members of the police unit responsible for the deaths of the two workers be brought to justice."
 kr.japan.3.a:0 "Continue negotiations"
 kr.japan.3.b:0 "This is getting out of hand, send in the army"
 kr.japan.4.t:0 "The Decision"
 kr.japan.4.d:0 "The revolutionary fever is spreading into other depressed areas in the Northeast. Radical member of the Shakai Taishuto are stoking the fire, hoping to launch an all-out syndicalist revolution. The Seiyukai and the general staff are demanding a declaration of martial law to crush the revolution before it starts."
 kr.japan.4.a:0 "Offer a reform package to appease people"
 kr.japan.4.b:0 "Dialogue is useless, declare martial law"
 kr.japan.5.t:0 "Recovering from the Lost Decade"
 kr.japan.5.d:0 "In what has come to be called the 'Lost Decade', The 1920's were a time of economic depression and political instability for Japan. The plight was particularly severe in the agricultural sector, and caused a massive demographic change as farmers fled from the depressed countryside to urban areas, flooding the labour market and further driving down wages. After leaving the Kenseikai-led 'Constitutionalist Coalition' and taking charge of the Government, Inukai and his government successfully expanded the Japanese sphere of influence into Manchuria and the edges of Siberia, acquiring a vital export market for the Japanese economy, but the agricultural situation continued to deteriorate as cheap agricultural imports from Manchuria bled into the countryside. As 1936 dawns, continued rearmament and state investment has fully rebuilt the industrial economy, but the issue of rural poverty remains chronic and unsolved."
 kr.japan.5.a:0 "OK"
 kr.japan.6.t:0 "Dissolution of the Diet"
 kr.japan.6.d:0 "The four year term of the incumbent Imperial Diet elected in 1932 is ending. Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi has called a general election for February 20th."
 kr.japan.6.a:0 "OK"
 kr.japan.7.t:0 "General Election Feb. 1936"
 kr.japan.7.d:0 "After the Constitutional Restoration of 1926 and subsequent political realignment, two parties came to dominate Japanese politics: the conservative Rikken Seiyukai (Association of Friends of Constitutional Government) and the liberal Minseito (Democratic Party). The Rikken Seiyukai has an absolute majority from the general election of 1932, but support in the countryside (Their traditional voting base) has been declining. As the political atmosphere turned against the ruling party, the Minseito, known as the Kenseikai (Constitutional Government Association) before 1927, solidified its electoral base throughout the cities and began to expand into the countryside, hoping to break the Seiyukai's absolute majority in the Diet. A new, third player in the general election of 1936 is the Shakai Taishuto (Socialist Masses Party), founded by social democrats and syndicalists in 1933. It is now time to see if the Seiyukai have retained enough seats to keep an absolute majority..."
 kr.japan.7.a:0 "The Seiyukai have defended their absolute majority!"
 kr.japan.7.b:0 "The Seiyukai have lost their absolute majority!"
