 japan.1.t:0 "Imperial Rule Assistance Society"
 japan.1.d:0 "All political parties have been voluntarily disbanded in the interest of the Emperor of Japan, seated on the throne and representing a divine succession that has been unbroken for ages. Our Imperial subjects must do their duties faithfully and diligently. Our Empire needs to mobilize against all enemies who don't accept our generous offers of friendship and fail to comprehend our Empire's far-sighted goal of world peace."
 japan.1.a:0 "Glory to the Rising Sun! Banzai! Banzai!"
 japan.2.t:0 "Civil disobedience in Niigata"
 japan.2.d:0 "Earlier this morning, a minor labor dispute has erupted in Nagaoka, a suburb of the Niigata Prefecture. Members of a local trade union occupied a section of one of the main industries of the city, demanding higher wages and better work conditions for the labourers. Local police quickly intervened but, after two protesters were killed, sympatizing workers joined the movement and occupied a good part of the city's industrial districts, while also calling for a general strike until their demands are met. The protesters are also demanding that the chief of the police unit responsible for the killings is brought to justice."
 japan.2.a:0 "Send in the army"
 japan.2.b:0 "Increase the police forces"
 japan.2.c:0 "Negotiate with the dissenters"
