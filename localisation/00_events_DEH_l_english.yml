 delhi.1.t:0 "Remnants of the Raj"
 delhi.1.d:0 "When the Weltkrieg began no place under the sun of the British empire responded more loyally than India. 'The swords of the martial princes leapt from their scabbards' as one reporter put it. From the trenches of the Western Front to the deserts of Arabia the troops of the British Raj fought doggedly for its King-Emperor and the glory of battle. However it was also the expectation of the nascent Indian national movement that their full support for the war effort would in turn translate into political reforms at home once the war had been concluded. As the Kaiserschlacht concluded the battles on the Western Front victoriously for the Central Powers and the campaign in the Middle East turned into a stalemate Britain and her empire accepted Ludendorff's Peace With Honour in 1921. The defeat did not deter the Indian reform movement who now loudly demanded Home-Rule to be put in effect. The British response, galvanized by the loss in the Weltkrieg, was draconian. As the British reneged on their promises the Indian National Congress became further radicalized and sabotage and terror soon became an all too common sight throughout the Raj. When the murder of 41 striking miners in Wales cast the Home Isles into the currents of Revolution India soon followed suit. Desperately trying to maintain some influence on the sub-continent the exiled Royalist government in Canada decided to grant India Home-Rule as a Dominion within the Empire under the leadership of Maharaja Ganga Singh of Bikaner. This however did little to calm the resurgent independence movement and thus when the first elections were held the INC boycotted the ballots. This in turn brought a broad coalition of loyalist parties to power in Delhi which held little legitimacy in Bombay and the Bengal, both centres of nationalist and socialist sentiment. The result was a bloody civil war when the INC declared their own provisional government in Calcutta, soon followed by a cabale of southern nationalist princes united behind the Nizam of Hyderabad. Despite early setbacks such as an invasion by the Afghans that saw Quetta and Peshawar ceded to Kabul and defeats, Ganga Singh managed to rally the loyalist forces and defeat the aspirations of both Calcutta and Hyderabad, declaring himself governor-general for life in the process."

 delhi.2.t:0 "1936: Delhi's Darkest Hour"
 delhi.2.d:0 "The Delhi government is the self-proclaimed legal successor state to the British Raj, yet within its borders different fractions vie for power. The progressive rajas and bourgeoisie are content with authoritarian dominion status, but radical nationalists and independence activists are still calling for the expulsion of the British. Tensions are running high inside the Red Fort as well as in the nation's central parliament. To the North, the Afghans watch our every move, while the decadent Southern Princes in thier so called ' federation' plot our downfall. To the East, the Syndicalist scum of the Bharatya Commune may well succumb to totalism, posing another huge threat for our nation. Reform is necessary, otherwise, we will be wiped off the face of the planet, and the British will have failed to rule India just like Alexander, the Mughals, and all others that have come before them."
