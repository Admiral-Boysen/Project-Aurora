 delhi.1.t:0 "Remnants of the Raj"
 delhi.1.d:0 "When the Weltkrieg began no place under the sun of the British empire responded more loyally than India. 'The swords of the martial princes leapt from their scabbards' as one reporter put it. From the trenches of the Western Front to the deserts of Arabia the troops of the British Raj fought doggedly for its King-Emperor and the glory of battle. However it was also the expectation of the nascent Indian national movement that their full support for the war effort would in turn translate into political reforms at home once the war had been concluded. As the Kaiserschlacht concluded the battles on the Western Front victoriously for the Central Powers and the campaign in the Middle East turned into a stalemate Britain and her empire accepted Ludendorff's Peace With Honour in 1921. The defeat did not deter the Indian reform movement who now loudly demanded Home-Rule to be put in effect. The British response, galvanized by the loss in the Weltkrieg, was draconian. As the British reneged on their promises the Indian National Congress became further radicalized and sabotage and terror soon became an all too common sight throughout the Raj. When the murder of 41 striking miners in Wales cast the Home Isles into the currents of Revolution India soon followed suit. Desperately trying to maintain some influence on the sub-continent the exiled Royalist government in Canada decided to grant India Home-Rule as a Dominion within the Empire under the leadership of Maharaja Ganga Singh of Bikaner. This however did little to calm the resurgent independence movement and thus when the first elections were held the INC boycotted the ballots. This in turn brought a broad coalition of loyalist parties to power in Delhi which held little legitimacy in Bombay and the Bengal, both centres of nationalist and socialist sentiment. The result was a bloody civil war when the INC declared their own provisional government in Calcutta, soon followed by a cabale of southern nationalist princes united behind the Nizam of Hyderabad. Despite early setbacks such as an invasion by the Afghans that saw Quetta and Peshawar ceded to Kabul and defeats, Ganga Singh managed to rally the loyalist forces and defeat the aspirations of both Calcutta and Hyderabad, declaring himself governor-general for life in the process."
 delhi.1.a:0 "Long Live H.R.H George V! Long Live the Maharaja!"
 delhi.2.t:0 "1936: Delhi's Darkest Hour"
 delhi.2.d:0 "The Delhi government is the self-proclaimed legal successor state to the British Raj, yet within its borders different fractions vie for power. The progressive rajas and bourgeoisie are content with authoritarian dominion status, but radical nationalists and independence activists are still calling for the expulsion of the British. Tensions are running high inside the Red Fort as well as in the nation's central parliament. To the North, the Afghans watch our every move, while the decadent Southern Princes in thier so called ' federation' plot our downfall. To the East, the Syndicalist scum of the Bharatya Commune may well succumb to totalism, posing another huge threat for our nation. Reform is necessary, otherwise, we will be wiped off the face of the planet, and the British will have failed to rule India just like Alexander, the Mughals, and all others that have come before them.  NOTE: DO NOT DELTE DIVISION TEMPLATES: They are required for certain events to function properly!!!"
 delhi.2.a:0 "Have faith in the Maharaja and the King-Emperor!"
 delhi.3.t:0 "The Death of King George V"
 delhi.3.d:0 "The ousted king of Britain, George V, finally succumbed to the illness that had plagued him since revolution swept through the home isles. As the head of state of the Dominion of India, Delhi, his death will certainly cause trouble amongst the competing fractions of the former Raj, but for now the Chamber of Princes will head a regency until the coronation of his son, Edward."
 delhi.3.a:0 "The Empire enters a state of mourning."
 delhi.4.t:0 "Afghanistan Invades!"
 delhi.4.d:0 "We will drive back these dogs and reclaim our lands!"
 afg.0.t:0 "The 5th Anglo-Afghan War?"
 afg.0.d:0 "In the remnants of the Raj to our south, dissent has sprung up like wildflowers in the wake of Edward VIII's succession. In Kabul, we have our own troubles keeping the latent discontent of reform down. A repeat of the victorius Fourth Anglo-Afghan War might cement our own position whilst winning new lands and subjects for the crown!"
 afg.0.a:0 "The time is ripe! Let us repeat our victories!"
 afg.0.b:0 "What does India have but cows?"
 delhi.5.t:0 "The 5th Anglo-Afghan War: Victory!"
 delhi.5.d:0 "Amanullah Khan's ambition of furthering Afghan influence in India has been crushed. The troops of the Dominion have crossed the Durrand Line, retaken the lost North-West Frontier Provinces and the cities of Peshawar and Quetta whilst threatening Kabul itself. The Afghan state is in complete disarray and her populace begging for peace. We should at least take back our core provinces, but any further military actions would be politically costly. Setting up a puppet government would work as well, but that would require just as much political capital."
 delhi.5.a:0 "We should push no further, after all, Afghanistan is the 'Graveyard of Empires'..."
 delhi.5.b:0 "We should set up a puppet government, to ensure the loyalty of the Afghans."
 delhi.5.c:0 "We must try to pacify the Afghans! When has that ever failed? Onwards to Kabul!"
 delhi.6.t:0 "Who shall rule Afghanistan?"
 delhi.6.d:0 "Now that Afghanistan is firmly within our sphere of influence, we must decide who its ruler will be."
 delhi.6.a:0 "Let Amanullah Khan keep the throne, the people like him."
 delhi.6.b:0 "Install Mohmamed Nadir Shah, he will be loyal to us."
 delhi.7.t:0 "The Imperial Durbar of 1936"
 delhi.7.d:0 "Last held in 1911 in honour of the late George V, the Imperial Durbar was a mass event celebrating the coronation of a new British monarch as well as a moment for important proclamations regarding the state. Now, with Afghanistan defeated by Indians and the British Empire still in danger, many expect the new monarch, Edward, to have his powers further weakened by an empowered legislature. However, he is still seen as a uniting entity among the disparate ethic, cultural, and religious groups that make up the subcontinent."
 delhi.7.a:0 "Hail Edward VIII, King-Emperor of India!"
 delhi.7.b:0 "Hail Edward VIII, and his Viceroy of India, Maharaja Ganga Singh!"
