By introducing bill C-7, a sweeping piece of legislation that addresses the poor state of the industry, military, and internal security, he hopes to prove himself to his new subjects. The first proposals are already on his desk for reforming the military industry of Canada.

Some of this has lead to the development of several groups calling for rapproachment with the Union of Britain. The Tories want to crack down on these groups and have proposed that a new parliamentary committee be formed with executive power over the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and a new civilian intelligence agency with Conservative M.P. Robert Manion as its Chairman. Such a committee would be the first of its kind in Canada and would cut back on many civil liberties and union rights. Ernest Lapointe has suggested that some symbolic laws be passed to bring some of the Tories on side and that a weaker committee be created with Louis St. Laurent as its chairman while the Progressives are adamant that no infringement of their civil rights take place."

### Event text ### 
 canada.100.t:0 "Parliament Debates Bill C-7 Military-Industrial Reform"
 canada.100.d:0 "Over the last month Parliament has debated military-industrial reform measures in Bill C7.  Minister C.D. Howe presented an ambitious plan that would improve the military industry of Canada by subsidizing key industries, and building the infastructure to support them.  Some radical members of the Conservative party have presented a plan that would involve nationalizing several key military industries outright.  Howe is outraged by this proposal, and is threataning to step down if it is passed.  Howe and the Torys could be brought together with the hopes of creating a compromise, but this could drain even more poltical capital."
