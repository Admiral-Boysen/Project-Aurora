 german.1.t:0 "Constitution of the German Reich"
 german.1.d:0 "Signed in 1871 after crushing defeat of Second French Empire by forces of the North German Federation  between representatives of North German Federation and four southern German states this constitution was a cornerstone for enlarging North German Federation thus giving the enlarged entity a new identity as the Deutsches Reich. According to the constitution, head of state or a president of Confederation bearing title of German Emperor is the King of Prussia as the president of the Bundesrat, the council of representatives of the German states. The Emperor installs the Chancellor, the head of government. Laws are enacted by the Bundesrat and the Reichstag, the Imperial Diet elected by male Germans above the age of 21 years. Hovewer it is Emperor, not Bundesrat or Reichstag, who holds power in the German Empire. With an option to dissolve Reichstag when he wish so, it is clear, that main political power in German Empire rests not in Reichstag as ultimate expression of peoples will, but in the hands of unelected German Emperor."

 german.2.t:0 "Hans von Seeckt dies"

 german.3.a:0 "I wonder what von Mackensen is up to?"
 german.4.t:0 "August von Mackensen retires"
 german.4.d:0 "August von Mackensen has delivered his official retirement message to the Kaiser, wearing his trademark Life Hussar uniform. The Field Marshal is already eighty-six years old, and wishes merely to live out his days in peace. The Kaiser accepted the resignation, and ordered a celebration in his honour."
 german.4.a:0 "We cannot change his mind."
 german.5.t:0 "Dispute in the General Staff"
 german.5.d:0 "After the death of Hans von Seeckt and the retirement of August von Mackensen, the Chief of General Staff has been involved in constant debate over which methods the German Army should use as a tactical basis, or doctrine. The traditionalists argue that superior firepower won the Weltkrieg, and would do so again, whereas the new school argues that this will be made obsolete and that a new form of mobility and strong spearheads should be the doctrine to base the German Army on. There also exists a self-deemed compromise faction, which argues that the current interim leaders should simply be made permanent."
 german.5.a:0 "His majesty shall decide!"
 german.6.t:0 "The Kaiser's decision"
 german.6.d:0 "Each group within the General Staff has nominated canidates for Chief of Staff and Chief of the Army. Surprisingly, Heinz Guderian, the leader of the mobility faction, was not nominated. The argument was that the Kaiser would more willingly support a nobleman. Guderian accepted and encouraged this decision. The Kaiser is about to address the General Staff in Berlin. Everyone, from soldiers to generals to journalists, awaits his decision."

 german.200.t:0 "Agricultural Crisis in Mitteleuropa"
 german.200.d:0 "During this time of great crisis, the agricultural sector of German economy is one of the most vunerable to turmoil. With this in mind, several junkers, representing the landed nobility of the Kingdom of Prussia, have asked for protectionist legislation and subsidies to their production. By imposing tariffs on foreign produce, we will strenghten this important sector of the Reich's economy. Such a measure is likely to cause further damage to the economy of our neighbours, however, as they are greatly dependant in trade with Germany. The wheat crops in the Ukraine are particularly vulnerable."
 german.200.a:0 "We must protect our own peasants."
 german.200.b:0 "We must uphold our foreign obligations."
 german.100.t:0 "German Naval Construction"
 german.100.d:0 "The Kaiserliche Marine stands as the strongest Navy in the world in the year 1936, but many challenges will face it in the coming years.

 german.232.t:0 "Question of French speaking minorities in the German Empire"
 german.232.d:0 "French speaking minority in our western border regions was always considered as liability, since their loyalty to our state was always in question. This considered true especially now, with increasingly belligerent Commune of France rising from ashes on our western borders.

Underground french syndicalist leaders are still on loose, poisoning minds of our french minority with syndicalist propaganda using existing french organisations as cover for their vile acts. In order to fully secure our territorial integrity, part of right wing political circles demand complete dissolution of all french or french funded organisations. Hovewer, even if such drastic step may seem neccessary, it will undoubtly damage our reputation among international community."
 german.234.a:0 "Current security measures are sufficient."

Shortly after Reichstag member Franz Seldte fanned the flames by asking why the Abwehr, run by von Schleicher's friend Ferdinand von Bredow, didn't find out that family of war minister's associate was infiltrated by hostile intelligence. While general von Hammerstein-Equord resigned and publically apologised for his daughters doings, the real question for von Schleicher was - should he pull strings to replace von Bredow and remove any further threats to his political career from that direction, and if yes - by whom?"

However, with the mechanisation of logging, it has put several thousand people out of work.
