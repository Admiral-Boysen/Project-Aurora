 nfa.1.t:0 "The situation of National France in 1936"
 nfa.1.d:0 "The Third Republic ended in the way it began: defeated by German arms, and facing Communist Revolution at home. In the aftermath of the French Communal Revolution, the whole apparatus of state and French military, sheltered in Marseille, quickly embarked with the French Navy to Algiers, fleeing the newly created Commune of France. After the peace negotiations with Germany, the French refugee politicians decided to start from scratch again, proclaiming the French Fourth Republic, in exile in Africa but claiming the French motherland. Soon, it was obvious that the parliamentarian regime was outdated, as the exiled leading politicians were mainly nationalists and authoritarian : the military subsequently seized the executive powers, under the leadership of popular marshal Ferdinand Foch. After his death in 1929, the victor of Verdun, Philippe Pétain, took his place, helped by his protégé, admiral François Darlan. Although the military regime of the French Republic in exile, still allied with the British monarchy in exile, has coalesced and stabilized, it still faces numerous threats. Will National France be ready to retake the fatherland in spite of the increasing troubles with the native populations, tired of French authority, or with the Young Guard represented by colonel Charles de Gaulle?"
