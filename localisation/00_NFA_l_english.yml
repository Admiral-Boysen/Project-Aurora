 ### Focuses ###
 
 NFA_develop_ALG:0 "Routes Départementales"
 NFA_develop_ALG_desc:0 "Before thinking of enhancing our industrial output we have to improve (and in some cases, creating from scratch) the infrastructure of the Algerian departments, which are far from being as developed we hoped they would be."
 NFA_industrial_expansion_ALG:0 "Dirigisme"
 NFA_industrial_expansion_ALG_desc:0 "Before our defeat against the red scum, Algeria was the most developed colony of our whole empire. But it was still a colony with low industrial capacity and the lack of financial input has not made the situation better... We should sponsor state-run companies to alleviate this problem."
 NFA_military_factories_ALG:0 "Algerian War Industry"
 NFA_military_factories_ALG_desc:0 "To reconquer our homeland we need to produce more weapons than the traitors against us. Funding new factories should help us reduce the difference between us and them."
 NFA_colonial_resources:0 "Colonial Exploitation"
 NFA_colonial_resources_desc:0 "If we want to fuel our industry we need resources. Thankfully our Western African holdings are full of iron, aluminium and other metals! If we dig new mines and make people work for us (willingly or not) we could improve our finances and not rely on foreign supplies for our industry!"
 NFA_sahara:0 "Prospecting in the Sahara"
 NFA_sahara_desc:0 "The Sahara is big and empty. Or maybe not so empty. Plenty of Berber tribes live in these territories where our reach does not expand as much as we would want and traces of oil have been signalled. Sahara could be the solution to many of our problems if we exploit it!"
 NFA_algerie_refinery:0 "Algerian refineries"
 NFA_algerie_refinery_desc:0 "The Saharan oil covers most of our needs but we could greatly increase our production with the development of refineries on the Mediteranean Coast."
 NFA_extra_research_slot:0 "Extra Research Slot"
 NFA_extra_research_slot_desc:0 "Promising young minds are popping up everywhere. We need to supply them with facilities to conduct their research. Advances in technology can give us the edge to reconquer our homeland."

 NFA_effort_national:0 "Effort National"
 NFA_effort_national_desc:0 "The Libération of France has seen many factories destroyed in the fight and many of the previous workers either killed or arrested for their links with the Syndicalists. We need to improve our industry to ensure that France never falls again!"
 NFA_amnistia:0 "Scientists Amnistia"
 NFA_amnistia_desc:0 "We have to admit that the Communards sponsored innovation in many fields. It would be wise to grant amnistia to important searchers so that they begin to work for us and for the New France!"

 NFA_Darlan_Focus_desc:0 "The General Strategy of the French State will follow the advices of Admiral Darlan, focusing on defending our holdings from possible threats, instead of recklessly risk our forces on enemy lands."
 NFA_fortification_focus:0 "Standardization of the Fortifications"
 NFA_fortification_focus_desc:0 "To better defend our holdings it is wiser to invest in fortifications and for this we need to standardize their construction so that we are not surprized by enemy landings."

 NFA_dockyard_focus:0 "Expansion of the Dakar Dockyards"
 NFA_dockyard_focus_desc:0 "We needed to build from scratch naval dockyards following the loss of France. Dakar was chosen to host our submarine bases and we feel it needs to be enlarged so that we can compete with our enemies in the Mediteranean."
 NFA_battleship_focus:0 "Battleship focus"
 NFA_battleship_focus_desc:0 "To defeat our enemies we will have to destroy them in decisive fights. What better weapons than battleships to win this fight ?"

 NFA_native_conscription:0 "Native Conscription"
 NFA_native_conscription_desc:0 "The easiest way to increase the number of available men is to conscript the local men into our army and make them fight for us. It was a solution that the High-Command was reluctant to implement because of the risk of sedition from these new units."
 NFA_Infantry_focus:0 "Infantry Core"
 NFA_Infantry_focus_desc:0 "The base of our troops is the infantry and we should be sure to equip our troops with the best designs available!"
 NFA_legionary_campaign:0 "Strengthen the Légion Étrangère"

 NFA_legionary_motorization:0 "Légion Motorisée"

 NFA_Petain_president:0 "Continuation of the Petain Presidency"
 NFA_Petain_president_desc:0 "The announcement of the democratization of the regime has struck many people by surprise.

 NFA_new_president:0 "New President"

 NFA_judiciary_frenchmen:0 "Colonial courts"
 NFA_judiciary_frenchmen_desc:0 "The Constitution of the Fourth French Republic had envisioned an independent High-Court but it was never implemented. We should reaffirm that French and colonized are not equal before the law by confirming the existence of colonial courts for the locals."
 NFA_extended_suffrage:0 "Extended suffrage"
 NFA_extended_suffrage_desc:0 "The upcoming elections require us to delimit who will be able to vote.

 NFA_limited_suffrage:0 "Pieds-Noirs suffrage"
 NFA_limited_suffrage_desc:0 "Some of the locals have asked to vote in the upcoming elections as citizens of the French Republic. We need to reaffirm that only French people can vote, and not the inferior peoples of the colonies!"
 NFA_Constitutionalism:0 "Constitutional Monarchy"
 NFA_Constitutionalism_desc:0 "The reestablishment of the monarchy has allowed the French people to be more united but our monarch knows that he can't rule alone, and most of the old Constitution will be used for the new regime"

 NFA_monarch_prestige:0 "Idealized Sovereign"

 NFA_homeland_reconquest:0 "Preparing the Libération"

 NFA_entente_research:0 "International Links"

 NFA_support_carlists:0 "Support Carlists"
 NFA_support_carlists_desc:0 "Spain is thrown into Civil War. Instead of supporting the decadent Kingdom of Spain we could support the true pretenders to the throne, our Catholic brothers, the Carlists."
 NFA_seize_rif:0 "Seize Spanish Morocco"
 NFA_seize_rif_desc:0 "The CNT has taken the African territories of Spain. We must swiftly ensure that these territories fall in good hands, our own."
 NFA_alliance_catholic:0 "Join the Catholic Bloc"
 NFA_alliance_catholic_desc:0 "The Catholic Bloc, headed by the Carlists and supported by the Pope could be an alternative to the derelict Entente. Our Catholic brothers are closer to us and it ensures us to have closer allies in the War."

 NFA_Church_support_desc:0 "With the Pope blessing our actions we have seen less political discord thanks to our alliance."
 NFA_military_cooperation:0 "Latin High-Command"

 #### Events ###
 
 nfa.1.t:0 "The situation of National France in 1936"
 nfa.1.d:0 "The Third Republic ended in the way it began: defeated by German arms, and facing Communist Revolution at home. In the aftermath of the French Communal Revolution, the whole apparatus of state and French military, sheltered in Marseille, quickly embarked with the French Navy to Algiers, fleeing the newly created Commune of France. After the peace negotiations with Germany, the French refugee politicians decided to start from scratch again, proclaiming the French Fourth Republic, in exile in Africa but claiming the French motherland. Soon, it was obvious that the parliamentarian regime was outdated, as the exiled leading politicians were mainly nationalists and authoritarian : the military subsequently seized the executive powers, under the leadership of popular marshal Ferdinand Foch. After his death in 1929, the victor of Verdun, Philippe Pétain, took his place, helped by his protégé, admiral François Darlan. Although the military regime of the French Republic in exile, still allied with the British monarchy in exile, has coalesced and stabilized, it still faces numerous threats. Will National France be ready to retake the fatherland in spite of the increasing troubles with the native populations, tired of French authority, or with the Young Guard represented by colonel Charles de Gaulle?"
