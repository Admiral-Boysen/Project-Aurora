balticduchy.1.t:0 "The United Baltic Duchy"
balticduchy.1.d:0 "Der ostliche Schutzwall des Kaiserreichs, is how the United Baltic Duchy came to be known. In this rather small client state of the German Empire, the full spectrum of political powers is concentrated with the Baltic German minority, who live mainly in the cities of Riga, Revel, and the islands of Osel and Dago. The rest of the country is populated mainly by Latvians and Estonians."
balticduchy.1.a:0 "Interesting, tell me more!"
balticduchy.1.b:0 ""Yada, yada, just let me play!"

balticduchy.2.t:0 "The Duchy's Interior Situation"
balticduchy.2.d:0 ""Administratively, the Duchy is subdivided into two Stadte, Riga and Revel, and four Länder, which are Oselland, Estland, Livland, and Kurland. As the country is organized along unitarian lines, the regions have only very little power. Moreover, recent tensions with rural Estonian and Latvian populations has prompted the formation of two specialized security commands for Livland and Estland.""
balticduchy.2.a:0 "Just what have I gotten myself into?"

balticduchy.3.t:0 "The Duchy's Overall Situation"
balticduchy.3.d:0 "Overall, the Duchy's position is not entirely enviable. Lithuania wants sea access, Russia wants its Baltic provinces back, Finland has pan-Finno-Ugric ideas. In addition, the lack of strong authority over the Lander of Estland, Livland, and Kurland severely hampers the economy. Outstanding interior problems shall have to be resolved before future plans can be adressed."
balticduchy.3.a:0 "Next game, I'm playing Switzerland."
