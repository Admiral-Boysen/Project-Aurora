            OTT_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Altay is the common name of a medium tank deployed by Ottoman Empire during Second Weltkrieg and late stages of Second Arab Revolt. It was intended for standardizing tank production, and as a replacement for the I. ZÇV and II. ZÇV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Aslan tanks until the end of the war. The Germans dubbed the Altay Tank as 'Clausewitz Pasha' because of its design was heavily influenced by the German Panzerkampfwagen V von Clausewitz."
